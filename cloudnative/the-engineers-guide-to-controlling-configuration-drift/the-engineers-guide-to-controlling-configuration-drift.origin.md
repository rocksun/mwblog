Configuration drift, the subtle yet dangerous divergence of systems from their intended state by some innocuous mistake or patch, can cause a minor glitch that frustrates users or a significant outage that cripples business operations.

Often, it results from seemingly harmless manual changes — undocumented tweaks that accumulate over time. Manual infrastructure operations are usually unavoidable even in well-managed environments, leaving discrepancies open. While configuration management tools like Terraform, Ansible, and AWS Config exist to help mitigate the drift, they can’t eliminate it because it also stems from people and processes.

This gradual departure from a known-good configuration — configuration drift — can lead to a cascade of issues, from unpredictable [application behavior and performance bottlenecks to glaring security](https://thenewstack.io/mitigating-safety-risks-with-ai-powered-applications/) vulnerabilities.

“Preventing configuration drift is the bedrock for scalable, resilient infrastructure,” comments[ Mayank Bhola](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayankbhola), CTO of [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/), a cloud-based testing platform that provides instant infrastructure. “At scale, even small inconsistencies can snowball into major operational inefficiencies. We encountered these challenges [user-facing impact] as our infrastructure scaled to meet growing demands. Tackling this challenge head-on is not just about maintaining order; it’s about ensuring the very foundation of your technology is reliable. And so, by treating [infrastructure as code](https://thenewstack.io/can-opentofu-become-the-http-of-infrastructure-as-code/) and automating compliance, we at LambdaTest ensure every server, service, and setting aligns with our growth objectives, no matter how fast we scale.

Adopting drift detection and remediation strategies is imperative for maintaining a resilient infrastructure. I turned to notable engineering leaders who shared their experiences and best practices for tackling the challenge of configuration drift. Their insights provide a roadmap for implementing effective strategies to prevent, detect, and remediate drift in complex environments.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
There’s a growing demand in DevOps for direct communication with machines, enabling teams and operations to collaborate and manage systems using a shared language and removing unnecessary layers of overly complex interfaces.

The trend toward reducing complexity — moving away from needless complexity — IaC allows for infrastructure configuration, deployment, and management through direct-to-machine code.

[Bhola](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayankbhola) shares, “We use tools like Terraform and Ansible to define and manage our environments as code. This allows us to provision and configure environments consistently, reducing the risk of configuration drift. And changes to the environment configuration are version-controlled, ensuring that all environments remain aligned.”
Tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or ARM templates allow you to define your servers, networks, databases, and other resources in code. This code is then versioned, stored in a repository, and subjected to the same review and testing processes as any other code in your organization.

“Initially, all our environments were provisioned through scripts with a lot of manual intervention,” says[ Naresh Rajendiran](https://in.linkedin.com/in/naresh-rajendiran-578aa129), Senior Director, Quality Assurance at [Kissflow](https://kissflow.com/). “To address this, we brought almost 90% of our infrastructure into Terraform. Now, we’ve started provisioning our Dev environments using Terraform backed by Git, where the environment’s Infra configuration is version-controlled. We’ve also started exploring Pulumi recently, which provides more flexibility since it allows us to write IaC in major [programming languages such as Python](https://thenewstack.io/why-python-is-so-slow-and-what-is-being-done-about-it/) and JavaScript. We leverage Helm to manage 99% of the resources for our application [deployments on Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/a-look-at-kubernetes-deployment/). This allows us to manage configurations efficiently across multiple Dev and Prod environments, with everything stored in Git for consistency and to minimize configuration drift.”

“The benefits,” Bhola remarks, drawing upon his executive purview at LambdaTest, “are numerous: repeatability, reduced risk of manual errors, a clear history of changes, and the ability to easily roll back to previous configurations if needed.” But, “implementing IaC is a cultural shift,” he emphasizes, “as much as a technical one.” It requires buy-in from the organization and a commitment to treating infrastructure as a first-class citizen in the software development lifecycle.

## Policy as Code (PaC)
We can define our infrastructure in code and write its rules. [Sandeep Kampa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeep-k-aa95a8241/), a Senior DevOps Engineer at Splunk (a Cisco company), posits that “PaC applies to both the application and infrastructure levels.”

At the application level, if you have an application that requires a login password or manages user access, these policies help maintain security and auditability. You can control user accounts, define access levels, and set password rules. “Anything outside of your policy should be authenticated,” Kampa strongly recommends. “This ensures that your application, whether a web app, mobile app, or anything else, remains secure. The same principles apply to SaaS providers and cloud environments. Organizations using AWS, GCP, or Azure often have policies governing access to cloud resources; implementing these policies for multicloud [access helps maintain security](https://thenewstack.io/role-based-access-control-five-common-authorization-patterns/) by preventing over-provisioning permissions.

The policies you set at the infrastructure level, such as those for SSH access, add another layer of security to your infrastructure. Ansible allows you to define policies like removing root access, changing the default SSH port, and setting user command permissions. “It’s easy to see who has access and what they can execute,” Kampa remarks. “This ensures resilient infrastructure, keeping things secure and allowing you to track who did what if something goes wrong.”

Ansible provides a powerful way to automate these infrastructure-level policies. From an administrator’s perspective, a policy like code can be implemented in Ansible to enhance security. While many enforcement tools exist, Ansible’s YAML configurations define permissions and policies for SSH access, hardening the system and [strengthening infrastructure security](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-strengthen-api-security-with-zero-trust/).

Interestingly, “Automation is a key benefit of using Ansible for policy enforcement,” says [ Shahid Ali Khan](https://in.linkedin.com/in/shahid-ali-khan-2aa084a3), Senior DevOps Leader at LambdaTest. “Once a policy is defined, it can be applied to numerous users and servers simultaneously, eliminating the need for manual intervention. This approach,” he underscores, “is reusable, scalable, automated, and consistent, allowing the same policy to be enforced across all environments (Dev, QA, Staging, UAT, Production) with minimal maintenance overhead.”

“Open Policy Agent and Rego are good baselines for developing policies that work with any automation and infrastructure tooling, including systems like Ansible Automation Platform and Red Hat OpenShift,” says [Matthew Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matburt), Distinguished Engineer and Chief Ansible Architect, [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en). “They also allow you to mature into more complex policies.”

You can define a policy that mandates encryption for all storage volumes or prohibits using default passwords. These policies are then automatically checked against your infrastructure definitions and deployments. PaC provides a powerful way to prevent non-compliant configurations from ever being deployed, catching potential issues before they become problems. It also simplifies audits by providing clear evidence of policy enforcement.

## Compliance as Code
Think of all those tedious compliance requirements you must meet — SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, the list goes on. Compliance as Code transforms these often vague mandates into executable code. This means you can continuously validate your infrastructure against specific compliance frameworks. Some tools can help map compliance controls to particular configurations and automatically check for adherence.

Development of policies and compliance is relatively new for most organizations, and this is where leveraging open-source technologies as the foundation of IaC and automation is beneficial, as these tools are maturing rapidly and have become a core part of the tool architecture. “When you combine advanced automation platforms and Open Policy Agent, you also get very close to an ideal compliance-as-code solution,” Jones underscored in our email interview, recommending Trestle, a suite of tools that works with them to manage the development and reporting of compliance, following NIST’s OSCAL format.

This saves a massive amount of time and effort during audits and provides ongoing assurance that your systems remain compliant. And it shifts compliance from a reactive, point-in-time exercise to a proactive, continuous process. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that everything is compliant based on the standards set at the organizational level.

**Mayank Bhola outlines the key considerations:**
**Organizational Context:**Compliance requirements are heavily influenced by each organization’s specific industry, regulatory landscape, and internal policies.**Tailored Approach:**While industry frameworks provide a good starting point, organizations must tailor their compliance strategy to their unique needs.**Cross-Functional Collaboration:**Different teams (e.g., security, sales, DevOps) may have varying compliance needs that should be addressed through collaboration and communication.
This helps organizations move towards a more proactive and [automated approach to fulfilling their compliance](https://thenewstack.io/want-to-mitigate-risk-invest-in-automation/) requirements, regardless of how these are defined internally. By enforcing these requirements as code, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of configuration drift. Because systems are automatically checked against the defined compliance policies, any deviations from the desired state are quickly identified and can be remediated, [maintaining a more secure](https://thenewstack.io/security-needs-create-more-work-for-open-source-maintainers/) and compliant infrastructure.

## Application Configuration Management
The applications that run on that infrastructure have intricate configurations that must be managed. Consider all the settings, parameters, and dependencies that dictate how your software behaves in different environments. Effectively managing these configurations can be a significant hurdle. “We had several challenges,” shares Rajendiran (of Kissflow) when describing their issues. He recommends “storing configuration settings in version-controlled files and ensuring they are applied consistently across environments periodically.”

Tools like Chef, Puppet, Ansible, or SaltStack allow you to manage these configurations across your application landscape. You can define the desired state of your application configurations in code, ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production. This eliminates the ‘it works on my machine’ problem (and the ensuing debates that sound like a broken record) and ensures that applications behave predictably regardless of where they are deployed.

However, it’s critical to use environment-specific templating for dynamic variables while keeping sensitive data secure with secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Parameter Store. “For advanced drift prevention, immutable infrastructure is the way to go — servers aren’t modified after deployment; instead, a fresh instance spins up with each change,” Khan (of LambdaTest) points out. Implementing immutable infrastructure effectively also involves using containerization platforms like Docker and orchestration tools like [Kubernetes to standardize and streamline deployments](https://thenewstack.io/deploy-mongodb-in-a-container-access-it-outside-the-cluster/). He adds, “When it comes to catching drift early, tools like Driftctl and Terraform’s built-in drift detection help spot unintended configuration changes before they become bigger problems.”

And when it comes to storage considerations, it is essential to address how and where your application’s data is stored. For instance, if your web application involves user interactions like form submissions or downloads, you want to capture every action in a structured format within a secure database. And if you’re using cloud storage, such as an S3 bucket, Khan suggests taking necessary precautions such as:

**Access Control:**Ensure the storage is not publicly accessible. Implement appropriate access controls to restrict access to authorized users and services only.**Versioning:**Enable versioning on your cloud storage. If necessary, this allows you to roll back to previous file versions, providing a safety net against accidental deletions or modifications.**Data Security:**Never store sensitive data in plain text. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. When dealing with highly sensitive data, use strong encryption methodologies like AES-256. Consider using a dedicated key management system to manage your encryption keys securely.**Regular Backups:**While versioning is essential, implement regular backups of your application data to a separate, secure location to protect against data loss in a significant outage or disaster.
Properly managing your application’s storage, including access controls, versioning, and encryption, is essential for maintaining data integrity, security, and compliance.

## Configuration Checklist
A checklist, even a simple one, ensures that critical steps aren’t overlooked during manual actions. But it’s not just about having one — it’s about treating it as a living document that evolves alongside your processes. “Checklists should be versioned, reviewed, and regularly updated to reflect changes in technologies and workflows,” Khan encourages. “They’re part of your organization’s operational knowledge, helping ensure even complex procedures are carried out consistently and accurately.” Even in a highly automated world, some manual tasks still crop up — especially during migrations or unique, one-off operations.

However, one often overlooked element in configuration checklists is validation steps. “It’s not enough to just follow the steps — you need to confirm the outcome. Adding post-configuration validation ensures that changes have the intended effect and prevents issues from creeping into production unnoticed,” Khan says. “Automating parts of the validation process where possible can further improve reliability and reduce human error.”

Well-defined configuration checklists provide a structured approach that prevents errors and minimizes risks. During our conversation, Khan urged assigning clear ownership for these checklists: “Clear ownership helps avoid ambiguity and ensures accountability. When everyone knows who’s responsible for updates and reviews, the process runs smoothly and has fewer errors.”

Using checklists within your team’s Agile workflow is helpful, especially for software updates or new features. “Define the entire process, from the initial stakeholder request through development, testing, and deployment.” Kampa (of Splunk) suggests aligning releases with your established Agile workflow, adding, “If the workflow is predefined and it’s been working, based on your agile [methodology], make sure whatever things you are releasing, in terms of who is doing what, who is deploying, who is validating, and who is approving and who is kind of gatekeeping things, that should make sure it all aligns to your workflow.”

A well-defined Agile workflow helps identify bottlenecks and streamlines releases. Kampa explains, “In that way, there wouldn’t be any confusion. Like if something breaks in the middle, you know, the workflow, where it broke. Checklists are essential but should be part of this broader workflow. Use regular stand-up meetings and sprint retrospectives to discuss checklists and overall workflow improvements. There definitely should be a checklist, but make sure it aligns with your workflow, like the end-to-end workflow of your business.”

## Credential Management
Hardcoded credentials embedded in configuration files or scripts constitute a significant security vulnerability and a common cause of configuration drift. They’re easy to overlook, can end up in public repositories by mistake, and are difficult to rotate. However, a robust credential management system — such as HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault — directly tackles these issues. These systems, often integrated with your identity provider, let you securely store, manage, and access secrets.

“Credentials can be automatically rotated on a regular schedule, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit compromised credentials,” Khan notes. Access has to be tightly controlled, ensuring only authorized users and services can retrieve specific secrets. These systems enforce the least privilege by allowing fine-grained control over permissions, providing users and applications only handle the necessary credentials. Sensitive information isn’t exposed directly in configurations, cutting the risk of unauthorized access and preventing drift caused by outdated or compromised credentials.

Khan also points out that “sensitive credentials should always be encrypted at rest and decrypted only when needed,” highlighting “the need for regular credential rotation,” a key benefit of credential management systems. Regarding access control, he suggests “securing credential storage by integrating it with your organization’s identity management system and using company email authentication.” This ensures that only authorized personnel can handle sensitive credentials, strengthening security.

## Centralized Configuration Management
Scattered configurations across multiple systems and files create a management nightmare and invite configuration drift. A centralized configuration management system provides a single source of truth for all configuration data in your environment. It could be as simple as a dedicated database or as sophisticated as a platform like Consul, etcd, or ZooKeeper. These platforms offer structured, reliable data storage — typically using key-value stores or hierarchical data models — and robust change management features, including version history, audit logs, and approval workflows. Role-based access control (RBAC) adds a security layer by restricting who can modify or access specific configurations. Many systems also push real-time or near-real-time updates to connected services and offer API-based programmatic access for seamless tool integration.

A centralized system makes managing, updating, and tracking configuration changes from one place easy. It simplifies troubleshooting, maintains consistency, and provides a clear audit trail of all modifications. “A key advantage,” Bhola notes, “is establishing a consistent, repeatable process for managing configurations across environments — from development to production. This consistency is crucial for maintaining infrastructure stability and reducing drift.”

When building a centralized configuration management system, “scalability is important,” Bhola expounds, further stressing the importance of high availability: “The system must handle both your current scale and future growth in configuration volume. It’s critical to prevent the configuration management system from becoming a single point of failure.”

Integration is also key, and Bhola recommends “seamlessly connecting with CI/CD pipelines, monitoring systems, and automation tools for smooth workflows.” Schema design matters, too, and he highlights that “carefully organizing configuration data ensures it remains easy to understand and maintain.”

Beyond these functional considerations, security is another priority, and Bhola emphasizes the need for “strong encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive configuration data.”

Centralized configuration management reduces drift, improves consistency, and enhances operational efficiency through thoughtful planning in scalability, high availability, integration, schema design, and security.

## Environment Parity
Maintaining environment parity keeps deployments smooth and reduces the risk of unexpected issues. Consistency in configurations across development, staging, and production environments is key. While CPU and memory specifications may vary based on needs, the overall configuration structure should stay the same — covering application paths, user access permissions, installed applications, and patch updates.

“It should be easy to roll back or revert changes,” Bhola stresses. “You shouldn’t have to go back and modify configurations in each environment individually if they’re consistent, except for the specs.”

For example, if your staging environment uses 8 GB of memory while production runs on 16 GB, reproducing a production issue should only require adjusting the memory in staging to match production. There’s no need to change the entire configuration because the structure remains consistent. The only tweak needed is increasing the memory, making it easier to identify and fix problems without significant changes.

Keeping configurations aligned across environments also makes troubleshooting more predictable. Knowing how an application will behave in production is challenging when environments drift apart. Use the same configurations, dependencies, and as much of the same infrastructure as possible. This includes container images, operating system versions, and network settings. Perfect parity might not always be possible, but reducing differences reduces surprises and fixes issues faster.

For teams looking to go further, [ephemeral environments](https://thenewstack.io/ephemeral-environments-are-better-for-scaling-devops-tests/) — temporary, short-lived environments created for each new feature or branch — offer an efficient solution to maintaining environment parity. These environments are automatically provisioned and destroyed, ensuring clean, consistent testing spaces.

“By maintaining consistency, you also minimize configuration drift between environments,” Bhola concludes, “keeping deployments more stable and reducing operational headaches.”

## Parting Considerations
When it comes to environment validation, setting up your configurations and hoping for the best isn’t enough. You must actively check that everything is running as it should. Automated validation is key here — it involves running tests that compare your actual environment with what you’ve defined. By integrating these checks into your CI/CD pipeline, you get immediate feedback whenever something drifts out of line. Catching those issues early can save you a lot of headaches down the road. Tools like InSpec or ServerSpec can help you quickly define and run these tests.

To this end, we will go on to audits and monitoring. You need to keep a constant eye on your systems to detect any configuration drift. Set up clear metrics to know when things aren’t right and use monitoring tools to track changes across files, settings, and applications. Alerts help spot anomalies, but don’t forget about regular audits, too. Whether automated or manual, these audits ensure that everything is still in line with your policies, catch any unauthorized changes, and confirm that your processes are working as they should.
