Cloud computing transforms the way organizations operate. However, realizing the total value of the cloud requires a strategic approach to managing costs and optimizing resources. [FinOps](https://thenewstack.io/finops-can-turn-it-cost-centers-into-a-value-driver/) is a practice that bridges the gap between finance, cloud operations, and [DevOps](https://thenewstack.io/devops/) teams to ensure cloud investments align with business objectives.

Despite the recent widespread adoption of FinOps, many struggle to achieve tangible value from its practices. My company recently [surveyed](https://www.cloudbolt.io/wp-content/uploads/the-real-state-of-finops.pdf) FinOps adoption and found that 89% view FinOps as the silver bullet for reining cloud cost management’s complexity. Although four out of five companies have a FinOps team, nearly half (45%) question its efficacy in real-world applications. While theoretically sound, many find that implementing [FinOps is more challenging in practice](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-finops-understanding-finops-best-practices-for-cloud/).

This disconnect between adoption and actual ROI stems from a handful of easily preventable mistakes.

## Mistake #1: Not Getting Your Baseline Right
Not establishing a solid foundation before diving into the intricacies of FinOps is a recipe for failure. Set yourself up for success with these tactics:

**Clarify Objectives**: Define clear objectives for your FinOps initiative (e.g.,[reducing redundant cloud costs](https://thenewstack.io/5-ways-opentelemetry-can-reduce-costs/), enhancing financial visibility, optimizing resource allocation) to align the organization and set the stage for progress. The[FinOps Foundation](https://www.finops.org/)has great resources to tap.**Define Cost Architecture**: Establish a methodology for cost allocation, including tagging strategies to monitor and track resource usage accurately. Set usage and spend thresholds and prepare a simple forecasting model, such as a spreadsheet with unit cost calculations, to aid financial planning.**Set Realistic KPIs**: Determine the first wave of KPIs to support a phased adoption approach and score some early wins. In my experience, a great north star is an excellent-to-Action” time; it takes your company to identify, analyze, and remediate a cost anomaly. As your maturity goes up, your lead time will go down.**Test Out Tools**: Deploy and configure necessary FinOps tools. Newer solutions that leverage AI will better optimize manual processes and streamline data analysis. Conduct smoke tests to ensure reliability and effectiveness.**Shared Responsibility Alignment**:[Define shared services and governance requirements](https://thenewstack.io/improving-application-security-requires-defining-better-metrics/), such as approved deployment patterns and justification processes, and implement tools for real-time visibility into costs and usage.**Engage Stakeholders Early and Often**: FinOps is a team sport. Maintain regular communication and establish a consistent meeting cadence with all relevant stakeholder groups to ensure alignment, implement best practices, track KPIs, and celebrate wins.
## Mistake #2: Assuming Everyone Will Embrace a ‘FinOps Mindset’
FinOps goes beyond tools and processes; it’s about teamwork and genuine collaboration among finance, operations, and engineering. However, don’t assume everyone will naturally adopt the FinOps mindset.

Though the significance of FinOps is widely acknowledged, its practical effectiveness is often doubted. According to the FinOps Foundation, organizational alignment is the most prevalent challenge to overcome for [49%](https://data.finops.org/#11730) of practitioners. As Forrester analyst and FinOps expert Tracy Woo states, “There is a lack of shared language and incentives between finance and engineering. They are still locally optimizing within their context rather than facilitating outcomes, leading to tension and poor adoption.”

To overcome this doubt, meet your teams where they are and integrate FinOps into existing processes and workflows instead of forcing the organization to change its behaviors. Establishing a cross-functional community of practice teams that includes representatives from finance, operations, DevOps, and cloud engineering can help get everyone on the same page.

## Mistake #3: Falling into the Reactive FinOps Trap
Savvy cloud experts know that constantly battling overspending without addressing the [root causes](https://thenewstack.io/lack-of-data-mobility-is-a-root-cause-of-cloud-native-ills/) is a losing game. This “firefighting” approach may put out some flames but won’t prevent new ones from igniting. It’s time to ditch the endless cycle of short-term fixes and embrace a proactive FinOps strategy that prioritizes prevention over reaction.

But how do you make the shift? It starts with getting everyone on board. The FinOps Foundation reports that [76%](https://data.finops.org/#11753) of organizations have either ramped up or plan to enhance their FinOps training. You can kick-start a cost-optimization mindset that scales by collaborating with L&D departments, establishing a Cloud Center of Excellence, and appointing FinOps champions.

Once the team is aligned, it’s time to establish a set of pre-defined [steps and best practices for every stage of the cloud](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-optimization-practical-steps-to-lower-your-bills/) journey — from design and development to deployment. The [key is to keep it frictionless for your developers](https://thenewstack.io/columnar-storage-a-developers-key-to-real-time-analytics/). No one wants to be bogged down by bureaucracy. Instead, focus on creating “golden paths” that don’t trigger long approval cycles. Empower your developers with the intel they need to make intelligent cost decisions, like price modeling solutions that reveal the true cost of new builds before they go live.

But the real game-changer is continuous optimization. By leveraging technology to identify and eliminate waste in real time, you can take a proactive approach to FinOps that boosts efficiency and reduces unnecessary spending. It’s not just about saving money — it’s about fostering a value culture across your entire cloud operation.

So, if you’re ready to break free from the reactive FinOps trap and blaze a trail to cost-optimization success, it’s time to get proactive. Educate your team, create your blueprints, and harness the power of continuous optimization. Your cloud spend (and your sanity) will thank you.

## Full FinOps Potential Unlocked
While [FinOps offers immense potential for streamlining cloud](https://thenewstack.io/finops-its-all-about-culture-and-automation/) costs and aligning investments with business goals, organizations must first address common pitfalls to unlock its full potential.

Maximizing the ROI of your FinOps initiatives begins with proactive measures, such as laying a strong foundation, embracing proven methodologies and technologies, empowering employees through education and training, and fostering a culture of collaboration.
