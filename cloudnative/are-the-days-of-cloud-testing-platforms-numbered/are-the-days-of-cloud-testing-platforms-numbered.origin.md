Software teams typically fall into one of two categories: those that automate testing and those that do not. There are also those that don’t test at all and those that plan to automate — but next year.

For teams that invest in automation, the equation is simple: the bigger the investment, the greater the returns, but also the higher the maintenance effort. While some organizations rely on third-party test execution platforms, others take a [Kubernetes native approach](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/), using tools designed to orchestrate and manage tests inside their own infrastructure.

Platforms like [Testkube](https://testkube.io) simplify this shift by enabling teams to execute tests efficiently and at scale with Kubernetes, reducing maintenance overhead while maintaining full control over the environment.

Should companies running test automation at scale rely on a third-party infrastructure — essentially outsourcing their test execution environment?

The answer depends on what problem you’re solving: mobile app testing? Definitely. Web app cross-browser testing? Maybe. End-to-end (E2E), API, load testing? Probably not.

**A Brief History of Test Automation**
**The Early Days: Manual Testing and Proprietary Tools (1970s – 1990s)**
Test automation started as an extension of manual testing efforts. Early tools were vendor-specific and required proprietary scripts.

**IBM’s PL/I Test System (1970s)**— One of the first automated unit and integration testing tools.**SQA Tools (1970s–1980s)**— Early regression and acceptance testing automation frameworks.**Rational Robot (1980s)**— Among the first functional testing tools for enterprise environments.**TestComplete (1980s)**— Enabled GUI-based test automation across multiple languages.**WinRunner (1990s)**— Pioneered GUI test automation with its scripting language, TSL.**SilkTest (1990s)**— Aimed at web applications and GUI testing.**LoadRunner (1990s)**— Focused on performance and load testing for web applications.
**The Rise of Open Source and Web Testing (2000s – 2020s)**
The advent of open source frameworks democratized test automation. Test frameworks such as Selenium for web apps and Appium for mobile emerged.

**JUnit (2000s)**— Revolutionized unit testing in Java.**TestNG, NUnit (2000s)**— Strengthened Java and .NET testing ecosystems.**Cloud-based testing emerges (2010s)**— Platforms like Sauce Labs and BrowserStack simplified cross-browser testing.**API, E2E and load-testing growth**— Tools like Postman, Selenium and JMeter gain traction.
**The Intelligent Automation Era (2020s – Present)**
With cloud native infrastructure and Kubernetes, modern test automation is more complex and more heterogeneous:

**Shift-left testing tools**— Cypress, Playwright, K6, etc., provide code-centric approaches to E2E and load testing.**Cloud and on-premises hybrid testing**— Organizations integrate best-of-breed tools.**AI in testing**— Machine learning assists in generating, maintaining and adapting tests.**Kubernetes for test execution**— Enterprises use containerized test execution environments for scalability.
**To Outsource or Not to Outsource?**
If your application is a mobile app, cloud-based platforms are a must for validating against numerous real devices. Managing dozens of iOS and Android variants in house is impractical.

For web applications, platforms like Sauce Labs and BrowserStack have traditionally provided parallel execution to speed up testing. However, in a cloud native world, the need for third-party test infrastructure is diminishing. Organizations are shifting toward Kubernetes-powered test orchestration, using solutions like Testkube without relying on external test execution providers. This approach not only optimizes costs but also enhances test reliability and debugging by keeping everything within the developer’s own environment and on premises.

**What Has Changed? **Three Big Things
### 1. Web Browsers Have Become More Standardized
Web browsers have become increasingly standardized over the years, leading to a more consistent and reliable web experience across different platforms. In the past, developers often faced significant challenges ensuring that websites rendered correctly across multiple browsers, as each had its own quirks and inconsistencies.

However, with the adoption of web standards and the evolution of modern browser engines like Chrome’s Blink, Mozilla’s Gecko in Firefox and Apple’s WebKit, these issues have significantly diminished.

As a result, cross-browser rendering problems are becoming increasingly rare. The widespread implementation of standardized technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and modern JavaScript APIs has helped streamline development processes. Features and functionalities now behave more consistently across different browsers, reducing the need for extensive compatibility testing and complex workarounds.

Although minor discrepancies may still arise in edge cases or with newer web technologies, the overall web ecosystem has reached a point where developers can focus more on creating seamless user experiences rather than troubleshooting inconsistencies between browsers, ultimately requiring less testing as well.

### 2. Monolithic CI/CD Processes Are Dissolving
The shift to cloud native application architectures built on highly distributed and often loosely coupled components is slowly dissolving the legacy “single pipeline” way of delivering software; gone are the days of a single CI/CD tool (for example Jenkins or GitHub Actions) that builds and deploys your application on a regular basis. Instead modern platform engineering teams are moving to event-driven and equally distributed build and deploy pipelines, often fueled by GitOps, to maximize their application delivery.

Cloud-based testing platforms are ill-aligned with this shift in software delivery. Instead of being handled by a detached (and cloud-based) software solution, automated test execution now needs to be deeply embedded into build-and-deploy pipelines where tests are triggered by infrastructure events and used as quality gates, preferably leveraging cloud native constructs like Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) for GitOps compatibility and continuous delivery events (CDEvents) for asynchronous build-and-deploy pipelines.

### 3. Kubernetes Has the Potential to Power Test Infrastructure
Teams can leverage existing Kubernetes infrastructure instead of relying on external cloud platforms, transforming the way test automation is executed. Frontend, end-to-end, API and load tests can be dynamically spun up as Kubernetes jobs within the same cluster where the application resides, eliminating the need for external execution environments.

However, there is more to Kubernetes potential than meets the eye. K8s brought many advantages to software applications such as

- Scalability and load balancing
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Efficient resource utilization
- Simplified deployment and automation
- Security and isolation
Why not apply those to test automation?

**Run**test automation inside a cluster as Kubernetes jobs. Store tests as CRDs for GitOps compatibility. This will create mappings of tests to specific clusters — dev, staging, prod or particular teams, which may have their own namespaces inside a cluster.**Define**and orchestrate different kinds of tests together, whether it’s Postman or Playwright or Cupress or K6, now these are just “jobs.”**Trigger**your[tests not just after a CI/CD](https://thenewstack.io/qa-meets-platform-engineering-seamless-ci-cd-empowerment/)build or with a GitHub Action but also on a schedule, or off Kubernetes events or any other external event.**Assign**tests to run on parallel Kubernetes nodes for faster execution and spin those resources down when done.**Collect**the results and artifacts of all types of[tests that were run](https://thenewstack.io/stop-running-tests-with-your-ci-cd-tool/)in one place for faster debugging and better transparency across teams and management reporting.
**The Verdict: Should You Outsource Test Execution?**
The way organizations build and deploy software is shifting, and so is their approach to test automation. The reliance on cloud-based testing platforms made sense when infrastructure was static and pipelines were monolithic and scaling test environments required significant operational effort. But in a Kubernetes native world, the traditional model of outsourcing test execution is becoming an unnecessary cost and constraint.

Modern software teams no longer need to choose between third-party solutions and high-maintenance in-house frameworks. The same principles that transformed application deployment — scalability, automation and self-healing infrastructure — can now be applied to testing. Kubernetes is not just a runtime for applications; it is a powerful engine for test automation.

Instead of treating testing as a separate process, siloed from infrastructure, organizations should be embedding it directly within their Kubernetes environments. Test workloads can be scheduled, scaled and optimized just like any other workload. This shift is not just about efficiency — it is about creating a [test execution model](https://thenewstack.io/a-5-step-framework-for-test-execution/) that aligns with modern software delivery.

Solutions like Testkube are enabling this transition, providing a framework where tests are executed as Kubernetes jobs, seamlessly integrated with existing pipelines the cloud native way. This is more than just a tooling change; it is a fundamental shift in the way teams think about test execution.
