State management and [reactivity](https://thenewstack.io/angular-qwik-creator-on-how-js-frameworks-handle-reactivity/) are at the [heart of modern frontend development](https://blog.pixelfreestudio.com/the-future-of-state-management-in-frontend-development/), determining how applications update and respond to user interactions. Over the years, imperative approaches have given way to declarative paradigms that emphasize predictability, composability and ease of maintenance.

In response to this shift, numerous frameworks have emerged or adapted their core philosophies to embrace declarative state management and simpler reactivity models.

## The Rise of Declarative State Management
Declarative programming is a paradigm that emphasizes describing what the program should accomplish rather than how it should achieve it. In particular, [in the context of state management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/handling-state-and-state-management-system-design/), this means defining the desired state of the application and letting the framework handle the underlying logic to achieve that state.

This approach contrasts with imperative programming, where developers manually manage state transitions and updates — which all too often leads to verbose and error-prone code.

Developers can focus on the “what” rather than the “how,” leading to cleaner, more readable code.

Declarative state management has gained traction [because it simplifies the development process](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/declarative). Developers can focus on the “what” rather than the “how,” leading to cleaner, more readable code. This paradigm also aligns well with the component-based architecture of modern frameworks, where state is often tied to specific components or modules.

## Simpler Reactivity Models: A Game-Changer
Reactivity is the mechanism by which a framework [automatically updates the UI](https://panel.holoviz.org/explanation/api/reactivity.html) in response to changes in the application state. Traditional reactivity models, while powerful, often come with a steep learning curve and can introduce unnecessary complexity. Simpler reactivity models aim to address these challenges by providing intuitive and efficient ways to handle state changes.

A simpler reactivity model typically involves fewer concepts and less boilerplate code. This can be incredibly helpful [for more complex projects such as online marketplaces](https://feedonomics.com/blog/online-marketplaces/) or finance websites. Instead of requiring developers to explicitly define dependencies or manually trigger updates, these models automatically track changes and update the UI accordingly.

A simpler reactivity model typically involves fewer concepts and less boilerplate code.

Such an approach not only reduces the cognitive load on developers but also minimizes the risk of bugs caused by missed updates or incorrect dependencies. The [shift toward simpler reactivity models](https://itembase.com/reactive-model-how-when/) is driven by the need for faster development cycles and improved performance. Not to mention, simpler models are often more approachable for new developers, lowering the barrier to entry and fostering a more inclusive community.

## Frameworks Leading the Charge
State management has always been a critical challenge in modern frontend development, driving the evolution of frameworks toward more declarative, efficient solutions. Gone are the days of manually orchestrating updates: Today’s leading frameworks leverage reactive paradigms, fine-grained tracking and optimized re-rendering to streamline complex UI interactions. Here’s the starting five for 2025:

### 1. React With Hooks and the Context API
[React](https://thenewstack.io/react-19-change-angers-some-devs-vector-database-use-jumps/) revolutionized UI development by introducing a declarative component-based architecture. With [the introduction of hooks in React 16.8](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1680-february-6-2019), state management became more intuitive through useState and useReducer. The Context API further simplified state sharing without prop drilling, reducing the need for extensive state management libraries.
React’s [declarative nature](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-declarative-programming-in-react) allows developers to define how state should be transformed rather than manually orchestrating every update. This approach reduces the risk of unintended side effects and makes state transitions more predictable.

### 2. Svelte and Store-Based Reactivity
[Svelte](https://thenewstack.io/youll-write-less-code-with-svelte-5-0-promises-rich-harris/) takes a fundamentally different approach by shifting much of the work [to compile-time rather than runtime](https://www.fourity.com/svelte-a-deep-dive/). Unlike traditional virtual DOM frameworks, Svelte’s store-based reactivity model allows state updates to be tracked efficiently without requiring explicit subscriptions.
Harnessing the power of a simple store system [with automatic subscriptions](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/stores), Svelte enables a more intuitive state management flow, removing unnecessary boilerplate. Its reactivity model is purely declarative, ensuring state updates are easy to follow and debug.

### 3. SolidJS and Fine-Grained Reactivity
[SolidJS](https://thenewstack.io/solidjs-creator-on-confronting-web-framework-complexity/) builds on React’s principles but eliminates the virtual DOM overhead by employing fine-grained reactivity. Instead of re-rendering entire component trees, Solid [tracks state dependencies at the granular level](https://labs.thisdot.co/blog/understanding-effects-in-solidjs), ensuring only the necessary parts of the UI update when state changes.
Solid’s reactivity model is entirely declarative, as it relies on signals — reactive primitives that automatically trigger updates when their values change. This eliminates unnecessary renders and optimizes performance without compromising simplicity.

### 4. Vue 3 and the Composition API
[Vue](https://thenewstack.io/want-out-of-react-complexity-try-vues-progressive-framework/) has long embraced declarative state management with its reactive core, [but Vue 3 introduced the Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html), offering greater flexibility and modularity. Vue’s reactivity system is built around proxies, allowing developers to define state changes in a natural and declarative way.
By using ref and reactive, [Vue ensures that state is always in sync with the UI](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals), reducing the need for manual intervention. Vue’s approach strikes a balance between ease of use and powerful state management capabilities.

### 5. Recoil: React’s Atomic State Model
Recoil is [a modern state management library designed specifically for React](https://www.guvi.in/blog/recoil-for-reactjs/#:~:text=Recoil%20is%20a%20state%20management,drilling%20or%20complex%20context%20providers.&text=Before%20you%20begin%2C%20ensure%20you,%E2%80%93%20Basic%20knowledge%20of%20React.), offering a declarative and atomic approach to state management. Unlike Redux, which relies on a centralized store, Recoil introduces atoms — small, independent units of state that can be composed to form complex state structures.

This atomic model ensures that only affected components re-render when state changes, minimizing unnecessary updates. Recoil’s built-in selectors further enhance state derivation, making it easier to compute derived values declaratively.

## The Impact on Developer Experience
The adoption of declarative state management and simpler reactivity models has had a profound impact on developer experience. Reducing the cognitive load and eliminating boilerplate code, these paradigms enable developers to focus on solving business problems rather than wrestling with framework intricacies. This shift has also led to faster onboarding for new team members, as well as AI adoption and further automation. After all, a whopping [62% of developer teams have already adopted AI](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ai-in-business), far surpassing other fields.

The predictability and simplicity of these models contribute to fewer bugs and easier debugging.

Moreover, the predictability and simplicity of these models contribute to fewer bugs and easier debugging. When state changes are clearly defined and reactivity is handled automatically, developers can more easily trace the flow of data through the application. This not only speeds up development but also improves the overall quality of the codebase.

### Performance Benefits
In addition to improving developer experience, frameworks that embrace declarative state management and simpler reactivity models [often deliver superior performance](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33655534/difference-between-declarative-and-imperative-in-react-js). Simply by minimizing unnecessary updates and optimizing reactivity, these frameworks can achieve faster rendering times and smoother user interactions.

For example, [Svelte’s compile-time optimizations](https://app.studyraid.com/en/read/6598/151198/understanding-sveltes-compile-time-optimization) and [SolidJS’s fine-grained reactivity](https://docs.solidjs.com/advanced-concepts/fine-grained-reactivity) both result in highly efficient applications that outperform traditional frameworks in many scenarios.

The performance benefits extend beyond runtime speed, too. Simplified reactivity models often lead to smaller bundle sizes, as there is less overhead associated with managing state and dependencies. This is particularly important for modern web applications, where performance and load times are critical factors in user satisfaction.

## Conclusion
Looking ahead, we can expect to see further innovation in this space. Emerging frameworks and libraries will likely push the boundaries of what is possible with declarative programming and reactivity. Additionally, the growing emphasis on developer experience and performance will continue to drive the adoption of these paradigms across the industry.
