Too often, GitOps becomes a victim of its own success. One cluster and one Argo CD instance quickly sprawl into 50 clusters and 50 Argo instances, held together by glue code and custom scripts.

The isolation that made [Argo CD](https://thenewstack.io/make-your-kubernetes-apps-self-heal-with-argo-cd-and-gitops/) secure in the first place translates into poor visibility and uncontrolled governance. Broken processes require your team to maintain custom dashboards and brittle orchestration scripts, wasting precious engineering hours that could be spent on more important projects.

## What Is the ‘Argo Ceiling?’

This pain point is called the “Argo ceiling,” said [Eric Minick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericminick), DevOps enthusiast, and [Dewan Ahmed](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/diahmed), principal developer advocate, at Harness. And the key to raising the roof is a GitOps control plane that centralizes management without ripping and replacing the tools that your devs know and love.

[Adopting GitOps](https://thenewstack.io/4-core-principles-of-gitops/) should not hinder your [CI/CD orchestration](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-ci-cd/). GitOps should provide a more developer-friendly and Kubernetes-centric experience.

If you’re having to script heavily to manage your GitOps environment, join us on Jan. 20 at 8:30 a.m. PT | 11:30 a.m. ET for a special online event, [Avoiding the Argo Ceiling: Scaling GitOps Without Maxing Out](https://thenewstack.io/webinar/avoiding-the-argo-ceiling-scaling-gitops-without-maxing-out/).

During this free webinar, Minick, Ahmed and TNS Host [Chris Pirillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrispirillo) will dive into why teams hit the Argo ceiling and how to implement a GitOps control plane to unify your estate.

## What You’ll Learn About Scaling GitOps

By attending this special online event, you’ll leave with best practices, real-world examples and actionable tips, including:

### Use Isolation, Not Fragmentation

You should run multiple Argo instances for security, but you shouldn’t manage them individually. A control plane gives you the security of isolation with the visibility of centralization.

### Stop Writing ‘Glue Code’ for Orchestration

If you’re writing a script to trigger a test before a sync, you’re building a platform, not shipping features. Orchestration should be a native feature, not a maintenance burden.

### Implement Zero-Config Governance

At scale, manual role-based access control (RBAC) fails. Enterprise governance means policies are embedded in the pipeline and enforced automatically, eliminating the “security vs. speed” trade-off.
