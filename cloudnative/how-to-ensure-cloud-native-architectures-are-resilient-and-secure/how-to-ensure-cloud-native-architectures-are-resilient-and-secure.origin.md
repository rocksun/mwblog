# How to Ensure Cloud Native Architectures Are Resilient and Secure
Organizations are racing to innovate and scale with cloud native technologies in today’s fast-paced digital landscape. But in my experience, this rush often comes at a cost — especially regarding security. In a recent project with a financial services company, I saw firsthand how prioritizing speed over security exposed critical vulnerabilities.

At first glance, the company I worked with seemed like a cloud native success story: microservices spread across multiple regions, fully automated pipelines, and frequent feature releases. However, during a security audit, we discovered a severe vulnerability in how their APIs communicated, which put the entire system at risk. The team implemented broad [API access controls to simplify](https://thenewstack.io/veracodes-sbom-api-simplifies-software-security-for-devs/) scaling, which unintentionally created a significant security gap. With just one service compromised, an attacker could move laterally through the system, potentially accessing sensitive financial data.

In my experience, [API vulnerabilities are becoming a common entry point for attackers](https://thenewstack.io/why-your-api-keys-are-leaving-you-vulnerable-to-attack/), leading to many of the data breaches we see today. A [2023 Salt Labs report](https://content.salt.security/rs/352-UXR-417/images/SaltSecurity-Report-State_of_API_Security.pdf#:~:text=The%20most%20eye%2Dopening%20finding%20from%20the%20Q1,with%2017%%20having%20experienced%20an%20API%2Drelated%20breach.) showed that 94% of organizations faced API security issues last year, mainly due to misconfigurations and poor visibility. These statistics underscore the significant risks that insecure APIs pose to businesses. [Gartner predicts](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4009103) that by 2025, nearly half of enterprise APIs could go unmanaged, creating significant security gaps. As companies focus on speed and growth, [security often gets left behind](https://thenewstack.io/implement-fine-grained-security-or-get-left-behind/).

**Microservices: Added Flexibility, Added Risk**
Microservices offer flexibility and faster updates but also introduce complexity — and more risk. In this case, the company had split its [platform into dozens of microservices](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering-reshapes-software-dev-at-bechtle/), handling everything from user authentication to transaction processing. While this made scaling more accessible, it also increased the potential for security vulnerabilities. With so many moving parts, monitoring API traffic became a significant challenge, and critical vulnerabilities went unnoticed.

Without proper oversight, these blind spots could quickly become significant entry points for attackers.

Unmanaged [APIs could create serious vulnerabilities](https://thenewstack.io/3-api-vulnerabilities-developers-accidentally-create/) in the future. If these gaps aren’t addressed, companies could face major threats within a few years.

**Why Automation Alone Won’t Secure Your APIs**
Automation helped the company release features quickly by [scanning code and dependencies for security](https://thenewstack.io/checkov-2-0-context-aware-security-scanning-for-infrastructure-as-code/) issues. Although automation worked initially, it overlooked more significant problems, such as overly broad API settings. Overreliance on automation led the team to overlook more profound design flaws. Although the automated tools caught more minor code issues, they failed to detect system-wide vulnerabilities.

I’ve noticed this issue increasing in cloud native setups. Teams often lean too much on automation without realizing these tools can miss subtle but critical issues, like overly broad API permissions or configuration shifts. While automation is crucial for speed, it’s not enough. Manual reviews and regular audits are essential to catching architectural flaws that automation might miss.

**How We Fixed the Problem: Building for Resilience**
Once we identified the vulnerabilities, it was clear the architecture needed more than a quick fix — it required a complete overhaul. Here’s how we addressed the issues:

**Enforced Least Privilege for APIs**: We reviewed all API interactions and reconfigured[access controls to follow the least privilege](https://thenewstack.io/from-it-to-devops-evolution-of-privileged-access-management/)principle. Each microservice was granted only the needed access, significantly reducing the attack surface.**Hardened Access Control Policies**: Wide access controls were tightened, ensuring each service had only the necessary permissions. This reduced internal and external threats and created a more transparent audit trail.**Combined Automation with Manual Audits**: While automation remained an essential tool, we added manual audits during critical points in development and deployment. These manual checks helped us uncover misconfigurations and design weaknesses that automation had missed.**Implemented a Service Mesh**: To[tighten up security](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-tighten-security-across-complex-and-cloud-native-environments/)between services, we implemented a service mesh, which gave us much better control over how APIs interact and, crucially, helped us keep a closer eye on communication patterns. Even if one service was compromised, the service mesh prevented lateral movement, minimizing damage.**Adopted Chaos Engineering**: We used chaos engineering principles to stress-test the architecture, simulating failures and attacks. This helped us identify and fix weak points before they could be exploited.
**Key Takeaways for Cloud Native Teams**
The lessons from this project apply broadly to any organization using cloud native architectures. Here’s what you can do to protect your infrastructure:

**Regularly Audit APIs:**Ensure all API interactions follow the least privilege principle. Broad permissions create serious vulnerabilities, especially in microservice environments.**Harden Access Control Policies:**Review and tighten access controls frequently to reduce risks. Regular audits are essential for catching overly broad permissions.**Combine Automation with Manual Audits:**Automation is vital for speed, but manual reviews can catch more profound architectural flaws. Schedule regular audits to uncover misconfigurations and design issues.**Leverage a Service Mesh for API Security:**A service mesh allows for tighter control over service-to-service communication and better visibility into API interactions.**Embrace Chaos Engineering:**Stress-test your architecture by simulating failures and attacks to find weaknesses before they become critical.
**Conclusion: Speed Without Security Is a Recipe for Disaster**
As companies increasingly embrace [cloud native technologies](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native/), the rush to prioritize agility and scalability often leaves security as an afterthought. But that trade-off isn’t sustainable. By 2025, unmanaged APIs could expose organizations to significant breaches unless proper controls are implemented today.

Your choices will determine whether your systems can withstand tomorrow’s threats. Don’t let the drive for speed and innovation become a security disaster. Resilience and security are just as important as agility.
