The writing was on the wall long before the global IT outages of June 2025 or [July 2024](https://thenewstack.io/7-urgent-lessons-from-the-crowdstrike-disaster/) disrupted operations across industries. For years, organizations had been pouring resources into security measures while potentially overlooking a critical aspect of their operations: [resilience](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-operational-resilience/). Enterprises should take these incidents as wake-up calls to reconsider how they balance these two crucial priorities in their operational strategies.

## The Security-Resilience Imbalance

Security and resilience shouldn’t be competing priorities, yet that’s exactly how many IT organizations have treated them. While security teams fortified the perimeter, resilience often took a back seat. Modern digital infrastructure demands both as non-negotiable components. A secure system that can’t recover quickly becomes a liability, while a resilient system with security gaps creates unacceptable risk.

Recent research reveals a startling statistic: [86% of executives acknowledge they’ve overemphasized security at the expense of operational resilience](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/insights/learn/execs-expecting-it-outages-2025/). This is less about diminishing security’s importance and more about recognizing that security and resilience aren’t an either-or proposition, but rather two pillars that must stand together.

## Why Balance Matters More Than Ever

Several factors have converged to drive this strategic rebalancing:

* **Increased system complexity:** Modern digital operations span multiple environments, countless microservices and intricate dependencies.
* **The automation imperative:** Manual processes are proving insufficient for managing modern infrastructure.
* **Rising customer expectations:** In our always-on economy, even minor disruptions can have major customer impacts, which negatively affect business and brand reputation.
* **Economic pressures:** Organizations need to maximize uptime while optimizing resource utilization.

### The Path To Resilient and Secure Operations

The transition to more resilient operations isn’t just about shifting focus away from security or simply implementing new tools. It’s about achieving a better balance between these complementary priorities, which requires [reimagining how organizations respond to and learn from operational challenges](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-operational-resilience/).

Leading organizations are focusing on three interconnected pillars:

* **Automated response capabilities:** With milliseconds mattering more than ever, human-only response times no longer suffice. Modern resilience demands:

* **Continuous learning systems:** The most resilient organizations are those that turn every incident into an opportunity for improvement through:

## Measuring Success: The Three Dimensions of Value

As organizations evolve their approach to balancing security and resilience, traditional availability metrics may no longer be sufficient. [Forward-thinking organizations](https://thenewstack.io/ai-reliability-engineering-welcome-to-the-third-age-of-sre/) are tracking value across three critical dimensions:

* **Revenue protection:** This dimension quantifies lost revenue during outages ([often thousands of dollars per hour for critical services](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/insights/learn/cost-of-downtime/#:~:text=IT%20leaders%20estimated%20the%20true%20cost%20of,customer%2Dfacing%20outages%20can%20cost%20%2419.8m%20per%20year.)) and how resilience and security investments reduce these losses. By containing the blast radius of incidents and implementing faster recovery mechanisms, organizations preserve revenue streams and protect customer transactions.
* **Operational efficiency:** This dimension measures the human cost of incident response, from middle-of-the-night escalations to L1 engineers and support teams. By tracking improvements in team size, resolution speed and resource utilization during incidents, organizations can quantify operational savings. Effective strategies [reduce the number of people pulled into incidents](https://thenewstack.io/fast-focused-incident-response-reduce-system-noise-by-98/) and minimize team disruption.
* **Innovation protection:** Perhaps the most overlooked cost is the impact on innovation capacity. This captures how engineering hours are reclaimed from incident management and redirected to core business initiatives. When developers aren’t constantly firefighting, roadmaps advance and technical debt decreases. Protecting engineering resources preserves innovation velocity and competitive momentum as teams focus on building rather than fixing.

## Looking Ahead

With major outages becoming increasingly frequent and every minute of downtime affecting thousands, the ability to adapt and recover isn’t just an operational necessity; it’s a business imperative.

As we move through 2025, the organizations that thrive will be those that recognize operational excellence is a successful balance of security and resilience. The path forward is clear: embedding security principles into resilience planning and building resilience considerations into security strategies from the ground up.

The result? Organizations are equipped not just to withstand disruptions, but to turn operational challenges into competitive advantages.
