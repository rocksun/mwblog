A major outage is affecting Amazon Web Services (AWS), with even Amazon's own web page reported to be offline and dozens of other online services and websites affected, including disruption in the UK.

AWS reported an issue to its [Health Dashboard](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status) at 12:11 AM PDT (7:11 UTC) of increased error rates and latencies for multiple services in the US-EAST-1 Region, effectively Amazon's home region in Northern Virginia.

By 1:26 AM PDT (8:26 UTC), the cloud biz said there were significant error rates for requests made to the DynamoDB endpoint in that region, which were having a knock-on effect on other AWS services.

At 2:01 AM PDT (9:01 UTC), Amazon's techies identified a potential root cause for the error rates, saying it appeared to be related to DNS resolution of the DynamoDB API endpoint, and they were working on multiple parallel paths to speed recovery.

Global services or features that rely on US-EAST-1 endpoints such as IAM (Identity and Access Management) updates and DynamoDB Global tables may also be experiencing issues, the company warned.

This appears to be an understatement, as dozens of websites and services remain unavailable due to the problems in Northern Virginia. The list includes McDonald's, DisneyPlus, Snapchat, [Signal](https://x.com/mer__edith/status/1980182701610348654), Roblox, Verizon, Fortnite, Venmo, Perplexity, Hulu, Duolingo, Perplexity, Reddit and Coinbase. Even [Amazon.com was offline at one point](https://x.com/sqs/status/1980185380566753735), and some users have also reported that their Alexa smart speakers and Ring doorbells had stopped working.

Banks and even some government websites have been affected, as well as comms applications like Signal and WhatsApp.

Across the pond in the UK, numerous services were down and out for the count, with Lloyds Banking Group's apps and websites hitting the canvas, while some UK government services were struggling, including HMRC.

We asked Amazon to comment, but it referred us to the Health Dashboard, which says the company will continue to provide updates as it has more information to share. Â®
