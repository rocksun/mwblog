AI, reliability and governance aren’t optional — they’re the foundation on which everything else depends. Data platform [Manetu](https://www.manetu.com/) unified [Temporal](https://thenewstack.io/temporal-tackles-microservice-reliability-headaches/) and YugabyteDB through an open source integration that eliminates complexity, strengthens resilience and ensures trust at scale.

By merging orchestration and persistence into a single, fault-tolerant system, the solution addresses infrastructure challenges that can make or break [AI deployments](https://thenewstack.io/ai-operations/). It also highlights why these decisions matter not just for performance, but for the future of AI governance and reliability.

## **Why Manetu Took This Approach**

Executing in the enterprise AI space means thinking beyond the standard features that enable customers to securely participate in the information economy. It is important to provide confidence in the reliability and scalability of any offering, as any fault or outage in a tech stack can become visible to a customer, a customer’s customer and potentially beyond.

Infrastructure decisions are not background details. They define the reliability, resilience and trustworthiness of everything built on top.

To achieve these infrastructure standards, the Manetu engineering team prioritized proven and battle-tested technologies. Temporal and YugabyteDB are two pillars that underpin its technology stack. By combining them, Manetu transformed strong individual components into a unified foundation that safeguards the trust customers demand in the age of AI.

Temporal ensures durable execution, guaranteeing that critical workflows complete despite failures. YugabyteDB provides distributed, fault-tolerant indexed data storage capable of handling massive scale..

The Manetu challenge in making the two technologies perform effectively arose not from their individual strengths but from operating them separately. Temporal requires a high-performance, durable store, something YugabyteDB excels at. However, running them in silos created duplication, added operational burden and introduced weak points that strained under extreme load.

By creating an open source Temporal CustomDataStore driver for Yugabyte Cloud Query Language (YCQL), Manetu turned their complementary strengths into a single, resilient foundation. Workflows now execute and persist within one system, reducing complexity while reinforcing trust. For customers, this means that policy enforcement, audit integrity and data lineage remain unbroken even under stress. By choosing to open source this integration, Manetu ensured the benefits extended to the broader ecosystem.

## **From Engineering Decision to Customer Impact**

This open source solution represented more than shaving milliseconds off latency; it eliminated systemic risks before they became customer problems.

Consider reconciliation failures. At the orchestration layer, they may appear as operational noise. However, downstream, they manifest as broken governance promises, including missing audit records, bypassed policy checks and workflows being stuck in limbo.

By unifying orchestration and persistence, Manetu created a foundation where consistency is a guarantee. Customers experience more than just technical improvements, but confidence that their policies will execute correctly, data lineage will remain intact and governance guardrails will hold even under stress.

## **The Broader Implications for AI Infrastructure**

AI amplifies everything: speed, complexity and risk. [Large language models](https://thenewstack.io/7-guiding-principles-for-working-with-llms/) and agentic AI systems operate at machine speed, issuing requests and taking action on a scale that humans can’t achieve. If your foundation wobbles, the amplification is catastrophic.

This is why infrastructure cannot be treated as an afterthought. It sets the boundaries of what is possible to govern, determines whether a system is explainable or opaque, and confirms whether policies are enforceable or aspirational.

Enterprises that treat infrastructure choices as isolated engineering details will face governance challenges that their customers can feel, from compliance gaps to security incidents to knowledge leaks. Weak foundations deliver shaky results.

## **Why This Open Source Integration Matters**

By bringing orchestration and persistence closer together, Manetu simplified the data architecture, reduced the number of moving parts and increased resilience.

The decision to open source the Temporal CustomDataStore driver for Yugabyte YCQL integration was deliberate. It allows the wider community to benefit from a stronger foundation.

Every design decision infrastructure providers make becomes a decision their customers have to live with. Reliability, observability and governance are not “features to add later.” They need to be baked into the foundation, or they won’t exist at all.

A solid, [reliable and resilient data](https://thenewstack.io/its-time-for-data-reliability-engineering/) infrastructure is crucial in the AI era, as it underpins everything else.

## **Try the Temporal CustomDataStore Driver for Yugabyte YCQL**

Are you a Temporal user interested in using the temporal-yugabyte project? Try this [Quick Start](https://github.com/manetu/temporal-yugabyte?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart) via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

From a terminal, run the following commands:

```
curl https://bit.ly/45O6aLP > quick-start.yml
docker-compose -f quick-start.yml up
```

This will deploy a full instance of Temporal, preconfigured with YugabyteDB as its primary persistence layer.

To view the Temporal UI, point a browser at <http://localhost:8080> and use localhost:7233 as your Temporal target configuration within your Temporal clients.

## **Looking to the Future**

As enterprises race to adopt agentic AI, they face a fork in the road. One path treats infrastructure as commodity plumbing, risking cascading governance failures. The other path treats infrastructure as the substrate of governance itself, a layer where policies, lineage and trust must be guaranteed.

The AI future will not wait, and neither can the choices that determine whether that future is built on a reliable and resilient foundation, or on shifting sands.
