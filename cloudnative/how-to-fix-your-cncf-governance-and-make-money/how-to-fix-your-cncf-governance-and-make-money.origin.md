When the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) [archived our OpenEBS project](https://thenewstack.io/openebs-lessons-we-learned-from-open-source/) in February 2024, we had two options: walk away or fix the identified issues and reapply to Sandbox to start again. Starting again is the hardest option, but it’s the right thing to do for the 25,000 users [OpenEBS adds](https://thenewstack.io/how-openebs-brings-container-attached-storage-to-kubernetes/) each month.

Here is the primary reason [CNCF](https://cncf.io/?utm_content=inline+mention) archived our project, how we fixed it and, by fixing it, started making money.

## The Ownership and Control Problem
The heart of our issue was a common governance problem. About 60% of CNCF projects have a corporate sponsor — a for-profit company that funds the project. When the company donates the project to CNCF, the project becomes the property of CNCF, and the sponsoring company gives up ownership and control.

But until the project recruits a community, the sponsoring company’s employees are usually still working on the project. Many CEOs assume they still have ownership and control over the project. “If my people are working on it, then I’m calling the shots.” This ownership and control tension led to our archiving, and unless we solved it, would continue to be a problem.

## How to Make Money by Sponsoring a CNCF Project
We asked CNCF how to solve the problem. A useful CNCF resource is the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) Contributor Strategy Governance working group. Co-chair [Josh Berkus](https://github.com/jberkus) explains the broader problem and solution like this: “The premise behind [open source](https://thenewstack.io/20-years-in-open-source-resilience-failure-success/) is you can get massive adoption, then derive revenue from a fraction of these adopters, making as much or more money than from selling proprietary software alone.”

This approach works really well when the software is complicated and difficult to support (like many Kubernetes installations).

For [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/), a successful monetization strategy is typically from one of three sources:

- Support and professional services
- Specialized distributions (with industry certifications or platform integrations)
- An adjacent product providing services for operating in production at scale (like management tools or reporting)
Open core is less common for Kubernetes, because then you are always deciding what goes into open source versus the proprietary version, and this reintroduces the ownership and control problem.

Assume that most of your adopters would not use your software if they have to pay for it. This is the adopter ecosystem that hardens the software and gives credibility that massive adoption brings.

For enterprises and larger organizations, paying for support or a specialized distribution is often attractive because it shortens time to market, reduces risk and is only a small part of their overall project cost.

These strategies are proven to work, and for us provided a simple approach that justifies continuing to sponsor the project without controlling it.

## Passing Ownership and Control to the Community
Figuring out a monetization approach for the sponsoring company that doesn’t require control of the project solves half the problem. But while the sponsoring company continues to staff the majority of maintainers and engineering, ownership and control tension will continue to be a problem.

This is where the Kubernetes community serves an essential function. By recruiting maintainers and engineering from the project’s adopter user base, the project gets additional resources and the sponsoring company is able to significantly reduce the cost to support the project (giving the option to shift some of the engineers to work on an adjacent product).

Growing and maintaining a community requires work; you don’t automatically get a community by having a widely adopted project. Our team has to strive to be inclusive and transparent. It takes effort to onboard contributors. We also have to participate and give back to the wider Kubernetes community, and help other people succeed with their own projects. We’re only getting started here but can already see the benefits.

## The Result
For our project, we shifted our monetization strategy and now have customers paying for support and professional services. We’re getting started recruiting maintainers and engineers and seeing that there is an enormous pool of talent we can call on to help.

The sponsoring company will be about to shift costs and, at the same time, see the project’s engineering capacity increase. By giving up control and ownership, we get a lot back. When we are done, it will truly be a community effort.

Kubernetes was founded on these principles — that no one should own or control the platform tomorrow’s infrastructure is built on. We will all share this ownership and control.

Sometimes, this process is awkward or painful. Sometimes, you get archived and have to work your way back. Free software doesn’t come for free — we have to work together to build the software, to build the community around it, protect it and sometimes we are protecting it from ourselves.
