Most of us lack the talent or skill to free climb an open rock face, even if we are inclined to do so.

Similarly, modernizing legacy enterprise computing estate and applications to manage complexity, unlock developer velocity, and accelerate business innovation can seem like a steep uphill climb. Budget and resources are always limited, and success requires learning new skills.

This transformation will present an even steeper grade if you are a VMware customer, given the dynamics caused by Broadcom’s recent acquisition of VMware. As Broadcom implements a product portfolio restructure, updates to product innovation investments, and pricing changes, IT executives and architects should start climbing toward a modern [hybrid cloud platform](https://thenewstack.io/vmware-cloud-a-single-platform-for-hybrid-cloud-environments/) immediately and chart out a de-risked path toward laying the foundations for modernizing their applications.

## Why Transform a VM Fleet Now?
Any enterprise that has been in business for more than a decade will have a variety of conventional servers, VMs, network hardware, and container workloads running critical applications that they cannot allow to slip.

At the same time, companies must deliver on modern expectations of our application estate, such as agility, portability, high performance, and data sovereignty, or risk falling behind. IT executives must deliver new [application functionality through cloud native and hybrid cloud](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-applications-for-multicloud-hybrid-cloud-environs/) architectures with the speed and scalability to meet customer demands in today’s competitive marketplace without breaking a constrained budget.

To climb into a hybrid cloud future, enterprises will need:

- Data interoperability and workload portability. Since no enterprise is an island, modern applications must support data from various sources: sensors on the edge, distributed cloud services, streaming Kafka topics, and cloud data warehouses. These data combine to enable advanced, compute-intensive workloads such as machine learning, AI inferencing, and analytics.
- Operational efficiency. IT budgets are tightening, while business expectations for faster application delivery and resiliency are higher than ever, pushing enterprises to elastic cloud infrastructure. At the same time, many companies are repatriating
[public cloud workloads to their private](https://thenewstack.io/private-vs-public-cloud-how-kubernetes-shifts-the-balance/)clouds and on-premises data centers to guarantee service levels and data sovereignty while avoiding unexpected cloud usage costs. - Modernization of underlying platforms. Existing VMs, of course, have to run on something, and they are often sitting atop legacy three-tier architectures, where compute, storage, and network are all different hardware layers. Or, they may be running on later-model VPCs or containers with some software-defined elements that still need further platform modernization to be ready for the hybrid cloud, whether the new resources will run on bare metal or in Kubernetes clusters.
- Diversification against risk. Every major enterprise software vendor must constantly rationalize its product suite as it grows. At some point, development and support personnel must abandon one platform so the company can remain relevant for the next generation of technology. End customers should also work with partners to diversify
[deployments from on-prem systems to multiple cloud providers](https://thenewstack.io/cdn-providers-rival-hyperscale-clouds-for-web-developers-deploying-jamstack/)while protecting against software licensing changes and end-of-support deadlines that could impact their futures.
## What Steps Can I Take?
Prioritize change. Take an inventory of your existing IT estate of applications, and assess the ‘6 R’s’ for what you want to do with each application — whether retain, retire, rehost, replace, refactor, or re-architect — with an eye toward virtualization licensing and current renewal risks.

Some of the software in your virtualization technology stack, including vSphere, vSAN, and NSX, may be up for renewal within the year, while others can be pushed from several years out. Also, some existing VMware elements may only be available as part of a more complete Broadcom solution package rather than licensed a la carte in the future.

Companies that can reduce their legacy license inventory enough might even afford to absorb the cost of maintaining specific legacy systems that are too hard to switch, perhaps by “lifting and shifting” some of them to cloud infrastructure *in toto, *as ridiculous as that may sound.

Lean on a partner for expertise. MSPs and system integrators need to be proactive about helping their customers modernize their clients’ VM fleets because there are significant downsides.

Technology buyers should ask their current or prospective partners if they have implemented similar VM migration or [cloud native enablement projects](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native/how-do-we-cultivate-community-within-cloud-native-projects/) for other companies. If so, they are likelier to have veteran talent with relevant cloud expertise on the bench.

Also, Broadcom may change its reseller and partner programs to favor only larger SIs and enterprises. In contrast, according to some reports, mid-sized or smaller consulting partners could pay 5X their current prices or get cut out of the loop entirely. That should motivate them to help push for quicker resolutions!

Migrate to a hybrid cloud platform. No company should need to settle for a single point of failure. Companies will have governance, risk avoidance, or data sovereignty reasons for maintaining specific applications or data in data centers or private clouds across multiple hyperscalers.

Using the [Nutanix Cloud Platform](https://www.nutanix.com/products/cloud-platform), companies can rebalance VM and container deployments across AWS, Azure, or on-prem without needing to refactor. This diversification approach offers many other benefits, including lower latency, less potential downtime, and better price/performance ratios.

Change hypervisors or keep them. Nutanix offers a transition plan for unified operations across hybrid multicloud environments for all workloads with included hypervisor (AHV), allowing license portability and consistent operations across hybrid cloud architectures. Thus, there’s no need to conduct a big-bang replacement exercise.

## The Intellyx Take
Most IT organizations have built up too much momentum to change direction overnight. There’s no need to panic and freeze. New licensing and packaging changes have already rolled downhill since Broadcom first announced the acquisition of VMware, and we can anticipate new pricing at any time.

Fortunately, there’s still some time to prioritize essential changes.

Whatever route you choose, there will be some work ahead. Modern cloud platforms can ease the transition and provide secure handholds for lifting your enterprise IT estate to a hybrid cloud future.

Keeping your options open to retain existing VMs and refactoring to a new [cloud platform while modernizing your applications](https://thenewstack.io/journey-to-the-cloud-modernizing-applications-fast-and-at-scale-at-fidelity/) that can run on-prem or in any well-known cloud hyperscaler is proving to be the safest and fastest migration route.
