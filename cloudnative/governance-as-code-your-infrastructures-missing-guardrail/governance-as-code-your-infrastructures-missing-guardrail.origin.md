As organizations continue to scale their cloud infrastructures, security and compliance have increasingly become intertwined with infrastructure operations. The latest [State of Infrastructure as Code 2025](https://www.firefly.ai/state-of-iac-2025) report confirms a worrying yet predictable trend: Although security and compliance risks are growing alongside cloud complexity, many teams still haven’t integrated formal governance and compliance into their infrastructure management processes. This oversight leaves infrastructure vulnerable to preventable breaches, costly downtime and compliance violations.

Yet there’s a clear way forward.

By embedding security, compliance and governance directly into Infrastructure as Code (IaC) pipelines — through practices known as [Policy as Code (PaC)](https://thenewstack.io/is-policy-as-code-the-cure-for-multicloud-config-chaos/) and [Governance as Code (GaC)](https://thenewstack.io/real-time-policy-enforcement-with-governance-as-code/) — organizations can proactively mitigate risks, improve operational consistency and streamline regulatory compliance without sacrificing agility.

**The Growing Need for Proactive Security and Compliance**
According to the 2025 report, 68% of organizations now operate across multiple clouds. This increased complexity not only creates more opportunities for misconfigurations, it introduces a new layer of difficulty altogether. Each cloud provider brings its own operational model, API surface, security primitives and policy constructs. Guardrails that make sense for AWS may not map cleanly to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Microsoft Azure.

Unlike the precloud era, where configuration management tools enforced uniformity across identical servers, today’s infrastructure is inherently heterogeneous. As a result, establishing consistent security and compliance baselines has become exponentially harder. In fact, 61% of respondents recognize that security and compliance risks are escalating alongside their cloud scale. The data suggests a disconnect: While risks grow, formal governance frameworks remain underdeveloped or inconsistently applied.

The 2025 report shows that drift detection remains largely reactive for most organizations, with fewer than one-third actively monitoring and remediating misconfigurations as they happen. Alarmingly, 17% admit to having no formal drift detection process in place, and another 53% only reactively address drift when it causes a problem or only with ad-hoc checks.

In multicloud environments, this problem only intensifies — each cloud provider introduces its own APIs, configuration formats and operational assumptions, making it difficult to maintain a unified detection strategy. Without cloud-agnostic tooling, teams are often forced to build and maintain separate processes for each platform, increasing both effort and risk. Platforms like Firefly address this complexity by providing real-time, unified drift detection across all major clouds, helping teams identify and resolve discrepancies before they escalate.

**Policy as Code: Embedding Security Early**
This [growing operational complexity](https://thenewstack.io/tackle-iac-tooling-complexity-and-growing-cloud-costs-in-2025/) — especially in multicloud environments — makes proactive governance more than a nice-to-have. It’s not enough to detect misconfigurations after deployment or identify drift once systems are already out of sync. To stay ahead, organizations are embedding preventative guardrails earlier in the lifecycle: using PaC to enforce security and compliance rules at the code level and GaC to align broader [infrastructure practices across teams and clouds](https://thenewstack.io/chaos-under-control-addressing-cloud-infrastructure-drift/).

PaC frameworks — such as Open Policy Agent (OPA), Checkov or Sentinel — enable teams to define and embed compliance checks directly within their IaC pipelines.

Infrastructure configurations can be automatically validated against these policies before deployment, catching issues early and reducing manual intervention. For example, policies can require that every S3 bucket is encrypted by default, enforce tagging for cost tracking, or ensure that configurations meet specific regulatory requirements like GDPR or HIPAA. Violations are flagged in real time during [code review or CI/CD execution](https://thenewstack.io/beyond-orchestration-a-comprehensive-approach-to-iac-strategy/), helping teams enforce security and compliance without slowing down delivery.

**Governance as Code: Driving Consistency and Cross-Cloud Standards**
Where PaC governs the correctness of individual configurations, GaC operates at a broader organizational level, defining how infrastructure should be structured, deployed and managed across teams, environments and cloud providers. According to the 2025 report, improved environment consistency ranked as the No. 1 benefit of IaC for 27% of respondents, yet many teams still fall short of achieving it in practice.

GaC enforces standards like naming conventions, tagging policies, network boundaries and resource ownership rules, ensuring infrastructure remains predictable, compliant and aligned with internal and external requirements. By codifying these high-level rules, organizations eliminate the need for manual audits or post-deployment corrections. Infrastructure that doesn’t meet governance criteria simply doesn’t make it past the planning stage, helping teams avoid costly deviations and maintain trust in the deployment process.

Together, PaC and GaC form a layered control model that allows teams to build infrastructure that is secure, compliant and operationally consistent by default, regardless of cloud provider or team size.

**Overcoming Barriers to Adoption**
The gap between recognizing rising security risks and proactively addressing them remains significant.

Why?

Part of the challenge lies in the perceived complexity of integrating policy enforcement into automated pipelines. Organizations often worry that additional security and compliance checks will slow deployment cycles or add friction to the developer experience.

To overcome these challenges, organizations are encouraged to adopt an incremental, iterative approach to embedding security and compliance checks. Starting with basic policies — like ensuring resources have required tags, encryption settings or restricted access levels — helps build confidence. Gradually adding more sophisticated governance rules over time can further enhance security posture without overwhelming teams.

**Leveraging Automation and AI for Compliance at Scale**
According to the report, automation-first pipelines have become the industry standard, with approximately 59% of respondents adopting CI/CD or GitOps workflows. Embedding policy and governance within these automated pipelines ensures that compliance checks run continuously, consistently and transparently, removing manual bottlenecks and reducing human error.

AI-driven capabilities also hold promise for further simplifying compliance and governance. Although only 17% of respondents currently use AI in cloud operations, 41% are actively exploring AI solutions. Teams can leverage AI-driven analysis for tasks like identifying policy violations or intelligently remediating configuration drift in real time, further strengthening their overall governance posture.

**Realizing the Full Potential of IaC with Embedded Governance**
IaC adoption is clearly mainstream (89%), yet only 6% of teams have 100% infrastructure coverage defined in code. To achieve full coverage and gain maximum IaC benefits, organizations must prioritize security and compliance alongside automation and efficiency. Embedding policy and governance checks into infrastructure pipelines isn’t merely best practice — it’s increasingly essential.

Leading teams are already seeing the benefits: fewer configuration errors, improved compliance posture, faster audit cycles and overall greater trust from business stakeholders. Embedding Compliance as Code fundamentally shifts the narrative from reactive firefighting to proactive governance, making security and compliance a seamless and integral part of infrastructure delivery.

The 2025 report offers a clear call to action: Proactive governance and embedded security policies are no longer optional. As organizations continue to navigate complex, multicloud environments, the urgency of embedding policy and governance into infrastructure pipelines only grows.

Organizations that successfully adopt PaC and GaC today will position themselves to confidently scale tomorrow, enjoying not just improved security and compliance, but a more predictable, efficient and reliable cloud infrastructure operation, fully realizing the original promise of IaC.
