The virtualization landscape is undergoing significant changes. According to Red Hat’s new [“State of Virtualization” report](https://www.redhat.com/en/engage/state-of-virtualization-ebook), organizations are shifting the way they approach virtualization, considering cloud native opportunities, cost optimization and future scalability.

Here are a few key takeaways from the report and what they mean for the future of virtualization.

### 1. Cloud Native Thinking Is Shaping Virtualization Strategy

One of the most compelling trends in the report is the [alignment of virtualization efforts with cloud native architectures](https://thenewstack.io/virtualization-and-containers-better-together/). Many organizations aren’t choosing between virtual machines (VMs) and [containers](https://thenewstack.io/containers/); they’re integrating them. While the majority of organizations have over half of their IT infrastructure virtualized (71%), 89% agree that a combination of virtualization, containers and [automation](https://thenewstack.io/pythons-automation-magic/) accelerates development cycles, driving the need for platforms that can manage diversified workloads on a unified platform.

This hybrid approach not only applies to workloads but also to environments, with 85% of organizations reporting that they run workloads across the [hybrid cloud](https://thenewstack.io/forget-all-cloud-or-all-on-prem-embrace-hybrid-for-agility-and-cost-savings/). Enterprises are seeking solutions that offer flexibility to build and deploy unique workloads across adaptable environments.

### 2. Many Organizations Face Common Concerns and Are Making a Move

A majority of organizations (70%) report actively migrating some or all of their VM workloads to new or additional hypervisor platforms. While cost remains a key driver, so does management complexity, vendor lock-in and low confidence in long-term support and innovation.

These migrations aren’t just technical transitions; they reflect broader efforts to modernize infrastructure while maintaining control. Decision-makers are looking for platforms that allow them to migrate at their own pace with opportunities for future innovation and minimal business disruption.

### 3. Virtualization Is Becoming a Broader Platform Decision

This year’s findings show how virtualization is no longer seen as a standalone technology; it’s viewed as part of a broader platform strategy. The ability to run VMs and cloud native applications in a cohesive environment is emerging as a key requirement for IT leaders planning for long-term agility and innovation. Additional considerations organizations are looking for in a new virtualization platform include automation and AI-powered capabilities (38%), integration with existing IT infrastructure (37%), more innovation and modernization opportunities (36%), and a more unified environment for diverse workloads (34%).

This shift signals the need for platforms that are open, scalable and capable of supporting evolving workloads across diverse environments.

**The bottom line:** As organizations reevaluate their virtualization strategies, the focus is shifting from maintaining the status quo to building a future-ready foundation. The [“State of Virtualization” report](https://www.redhat.com/en/engage/state-of-virtualization-ebook) reinforces what many IT leaders already recognize: flexibility, integration and cost efficiency are key to navigating this transition.
