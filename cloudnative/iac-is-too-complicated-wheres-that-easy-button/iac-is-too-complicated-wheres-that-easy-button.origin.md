# IaC Is Too Complicated. Where’s That ‘Easy Button’?

It’s been 20 years since Puppet planted the seeds of today’s [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-infrastructure-as-code/), and it hasn’t gotten any easier — in many ways, it’s more complicated than ever.

The early entrants, Puppet and Chef, gave way to tools like Ansible, Terraform and Pulumi, which brought new capabilities for infrastructure provisioning. Then cloud computing emerged and turned IaC into a fundamental software development practice. Now, we have [OpenTofu stepping in](https://thenewstack.io/will-opentofu-dethrone-terraform-in-iac) to fill Terraform’s no-longer-open-source shoes, and GitOps integrating IaC with version control.

Despite the volatility, organizations clearly understand the value of IaC. According to Firefly’s [2025 State of IaC](https://www.firefly.ai/state-of-iac-2025) report, the vast majority of organizations — 89% — are using IaC, but [only about 6%](https://thenewstack.io/the-maturing-state-of-infrastructure-as-code-in-2025) have fully codified their cloud. The result is severe complexity, characterized by inconsistency, poor stability, [tooling fragmentation](https://thenewstack.io/terraform-and-the-tooling-multiverse-in-the-future-of-iac) and slow development pipelines.

Configuration drift — one of the main issues IaC is supposed to solve — remains a pressing problem, but fewer than a third of Firefly survey respondents are actively trying to solve it by continuously monitoring and remediating drift.

Many teams are exploring AI to create shortcuts to greater IaC adoption, but it’s still early days, with only 17% of teams using AI in cloud ops.

## Find Your Way Out of the IaC Spiral of Chaos
So where does this leave us today? According to the 2025 State of IaC, we’re spiraling into [self-inflicted complexity](https://thenewstack.io/why-your-infrastructure-as-code-strategy-still-sucks), in a vicious cycle: adding more clouds, more tools and more automation — and then doing it all over again when things become unmanageable.

If you’re trying to figure out the right IaC approach for your organization, join us on June 17 at 11:30 a.m. ET, 8:30 a.m. PT, for a special online event, [Inside the 2025 State of IaC: Tools, Trends, and Tactical Solutions](https://streamyard.com/watch/VDV53gtewG7Z).

During this free webinar, [Ido Neeman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ido-neeman/), CEO and co-founder of Firefly, and [Chris Pirillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrispirillo/), TNS host, will dive into the top trends and most surprising findings from this year’s survey — plus some bonus insights we uncovered that didn’t make the published report. They’ll expose why 65% of teams face increasing complexity — despite record IaC adoption — and share exclusive data on how high-performing teams are breaking this cycle.
