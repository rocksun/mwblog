Traditional manufacturing best practices offer valuable insights that enrich our approach to [modern software development](https://thenewstack.io/where-is-the-complexity-of-modern-software-coming-from/).

Manufacturers rely on quality control, supply chain management and stringent standards for efficient production. Software developers can adopt these principles when incorporating open source components into their development processes.

With software development increasingly resembling the assembly of complex products from smaller parts — [many of them open source](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/a-summary-of-census-ii-open-source-software-application-libraries-the-world-depends-on) — there are lessons to be learned from how manufacturers optimize their processes to ensure quality and reduce risk.

Let’s explore these lessons and see how they can help organizations manage their [software supply chains](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/articles/what-is-software-supply-chain).

## Understanding the Software Supply Chain
Just as a traditional supply chain involves sourcing, assembling and distributing physical goods, a software supply chain consists of gathering, integrating and maintaining software components to build applications.

In both industries, quality, reliability, and transparency directly impact success. A broken link in a physical supply chain can result in production delays or defects.

Similarly, a vulnerable or outdated software component can expose software to [security risks](https://thenewstack.io/navigating-open-source-software-risks-whose-job-is-it-anyway/), license issues or performance problems.

## Quality Control in Software Components
One fundamental principle borrowed from manufacturing is quality control. In traditional manufacturing, companies depend on high-quality components from trusted suppliers to ensure the safety and reliability of the final product.

In software development, this involves meticulously choosing open source components that are well-maintained, secure and free from [vulnerabilities](https://thenewstack.io/vulnerabilities-versus-intentionally-malicious-software-components/).

Manufacturers conduct quality checks early in the process to identify and resolve issues before they escalate. In software development, this approach is mirrored by practices such as automated testing, code reviews and [software composition analysis (SCA)](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/articles/what-is-software-composition-analysis) to continuously oversee the health and security of components.

To enhance software development using principles from manufacturing, consider the following:

- Employ high-quality components, including secure and reliable open source elements.
- Address defects promptly in the early stages.
- Prevent known defects from advancing downstream, especially into production.
## Supplier Management and Open Source Projects
In manufacturing, companies usually follow a structured process to select and evaluate suppliers. They prioritize those who meet rigorous quality standards and have a reputation for providing dependable components.

When selecting components to integrate into your software, you typically evaluate their maintainability, security practices and update frequency. Open source components vary in quality. Some benefit from a large, active community, while others may be neglected or rarely updated.

Much like manufacturers mitigate risks by choosing reliable suppliers, software teams should avoid relying on unmaintained or poorly managed open source components.

When selecting for high-quality components, consider the following criteria:

- Regular maintenance and update frequency.
- A community of active and responsive contributors.
- A proven history of security and reliability.
- Transparent contribution guidelines and open governance.
## Tracking and Transparency With SBOMs
Manufacturers rely on bills of materials (BOMs) to track every component in their products. This transparency enables them to swiftly pinpoint the source of any issues that arise, ensuring they have a comprehensive understanding of their supply chain.

In software, this same principle is applied through [software bills of materials (SBOMs)](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/articles/what-is-software-bill-of-materials), which list all the components, [dependencies](https://thenewstack.io/a-guide-to-software-dependencies/) and licenses used in a software application. SBOMs are increasingly becoming critical resources for [managing software supply chains](https://thenewstack.io/software-composition-analysis-and-sboms-a-united-defense/), enabling developers and security teams to maintain visibility over what’s being used in their applications.

Without an SBOM, organizations risk being unaware of outdated or vulnerable components in their software, making it difficult to address security issues.

## Automation: Scaling Quality and Security
As with manufacturing, where automation streamlines processes and improves efficiency, software development also relies on automation to manage the complexities of modern applications.

It’s nearly impossible to monitor open source components manually at scale. But with software composition analysis, developers can automate the process of [identifying security risks](https://thenewstack.io/a-guide-to-open-source-software-security/) and ensuring compliance.

Automation not only accelerates development but also reduces the risk of human error, so teams can manage vast numbers of components and dependencies efficiently.

Opportunities for automation to enhance software supply chains include:

- Continuously monitor open source components for security vulnerabilities.
- Automatically update and patch known issues.
- Automatically generate and verify SBOMs.
## Recalls and Proactive Issue Resolution
In manufacturing, product recalls address defects or safety issues in distributed products. While recalling software isn’t as straightforward, proactively resolving known issues is just as crucial. Manufacturers aim to detect defects early and prevent customer impact.

Likewise, software teams can focus on identifying and resolving vulnerabilities before they reach production environments.

By incorporating security and quality checks throughout the development process — known as “[shifting left](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/articles/what-is-shift-left)” — software organizations can minimize the chances of having to “recall” their software due to security breaches or critical failures.

## Leverage Manufacturing Principles for Successful Software Development
By adopting manufacturing best practices such as rigorous quality control, careful supplier management and transparent tracking through SBOMs, software organizations can enhance security, efficiency and reliability.

As open source software remains integral to modern development, implementing these principles will help maintain robust and resilient software supply chains.

By drawing from the successes of manufacturing, software teams can effectively navigate the complexities of open source consumption and create more dependable applications at scale.
