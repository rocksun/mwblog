Most cloud-using enterprises have implemented Infrastructure as Code (IaC), looking to automate, standardize and streamline infrastructure management.

But a quick glance at the most popular IaC-related stories on TNS last year shows a sad truth: [IaC is still terrible for most companies](https://thenewstack.io/infrastructure-as-code-in-2024-why-its-still-so-terrible/).

While [the turmoil](https://thenewstack.io/is-terraform-dead-revive-your-infrastructure-as-code-strategy/) created by IaC licensing changes and acquisitions over the past several years have been distractions, the stark reality is that IaC still comes with significant practical blockers, including cost, tooling complexity and capacity of engineering resources, according to [two-thirds of companies managing cloud resources](https://www.firefly.ai/state-of-iac-2024).

The result is, despite your significant investments, without the right approach, your IaC might be doing more to frustrate your DevOps team than help them.
