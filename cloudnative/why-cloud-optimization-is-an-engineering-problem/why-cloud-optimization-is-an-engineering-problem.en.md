You know the drill: Each month your organization’s cloud bill comes in, higher than the month before, despite all your efforts to minimize overprovisioning and shutter idle workloads. Next thing you know, finance is storming into your department, and you’re combing through the invoice, urgently looking for ways to bring costs down so you don’t repeat this exercise again next month.

All the work your organization put into [FinOps](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-build-a-finops-strategy-that-works/) was apparently for nothing. And you’re at your wits’ end, not sure what to do next.

## Why FinOps Fails

Most organizations try to solve cloud overspending backward: They wait until the bill comes in before looking for savings. They rely on reactive cost controls, manual audits or finance-led governance that isn’t tied to your architectural decisions.

Like so many other things in software engineering, the solution is shifting left — reframing cloud value as an engineering responsibility from the start. Instead of asking how to reduce costs, the right question is: **“How do we prevent waste from being deployed in the first place?”**

## Reframing the Solution

If you’re ready to shift cloud optimization left — embedding optimization, security and governance directly into design, CI/CD and deployment workflows — where decisions are cheapest to fix and easiest to automate, join us on Jan. 15 at 12:30 PT | 3:30 p.m. ET for a special online event, **[Cloud Cost Optimization Isn’t Broken. The Approach Is](https://thenewstack.io/webinar/cloud-cost-optimization-isnt-broken-the-approach-is/)**.

During this free webinar, [Ben Linares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminlinares/) and [Patrick Brogan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pbrogan1/), FinOps specialists at Harness, and TNS Host [Chris Pirillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrispirillo/) will explore how a shift-left strategy enables proactive optimization. They’ll also show how Kubernetes environments can be continuously aligned with intent, without slowing developers down.

## What You’ll Learn

By attending this special online event, you’ll leave with best practices, real-world examples and actionable tips:

* **Cloud value is a balance, not a bill:** True cloud value combines cost efficiency, reliability, security and developer velocity. Optimizing one at the expense of the others creates hidden debt.
* **Shift-left beats clean-up:** The earlier optimization and governance are introduced — design, pull requests (PRs) and pipelines — the less rework, firefighting and spend remediation are required later.
* **Kubernetes needs continuous alignment:** Drift between declared intent and runtime reality is inevitable without automation. Zero-drift practices ensure clusters stay optimized, compliant and predictable over time.
* **Policy as code, not meetings:** Architecture standards and cost controls scale only when enforced automatically. Humans review intent; systems enforce outcomes.
