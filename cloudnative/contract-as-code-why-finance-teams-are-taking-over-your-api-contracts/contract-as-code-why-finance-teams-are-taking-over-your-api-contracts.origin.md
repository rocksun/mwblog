In cloud native environments, we often discuss how contracts between microservices define stable interfaces and explicit dependencies. However, there’s another type of contract that’s just as critical but rarely gets the same developer attention: business agreements. As the founder of Concord, I’ve observed how enterprises managing thousands of vendor relationships struggle to integrate these human contracts into their automated workflows, creating significant bottlenecks for DevOps teams.

Organizations adopting [Kubernetes and containerized architectures](https://thenewstack.io/the-impact-of-containerization-on-apm-strategies/) create elegant systems in which services communicate through well-defined APIs. Teams write contracts for these interactions, ensuring stable interfaces as individual components evolve independently.

Yet many DevOps teams are discovering a hidden technical debt: the business contracts governing these same systems aren’t integrated into their automation pipelines. Research from [World Commerce & Contracting](https://www.worldcc.com/Resources/Content-Hub/View/ArticleId/9773) indicates organizations lose an average of 9.2% of contract value due to poor management processes.

**The Rise of the Contract API**
Forward-thinking companies are now applying cloud native principles to contract management. Just as infrastructure became code with tools like Terraform and Ansible, we’re seeing a similar transformation with business agreements becoming “contracts-as-code.”

This shift integrates critical contract information directly into the [CI/CD pipeline through APIs that connect legal document management](https://thenewstack.io/how-platform-engineering-helps-manage-innovation-responsibly/) with operational workflows. Contract experts at[ ContractNerds](https://contractnerds.com/how-to-automate-contract-workflows-with-apis/) highlight how API connections enable automation and improve workflow management beyond what traditional contract lifecycle management systems can achieve alone.

**New Owners: Why CFOs Are Leading the Charge**
Interestingly, this cloud native contract revolution hasn’t been led by legal departments. From our experience working with over 1,500 companies, contract ownership is rapidly shifting to finance and operations teams, with CFOs becoming the primary stakeholders in contract management systems.

There are several reasons for this power shift:

**Financial Visibility**: CFOs need real-time visibility into contract commitments across the organization to build accurate financial forecasts, especially for cloud resources with dynamic pricing.**Operational Integration**: Unlike legal teams focused on risk mitigation,[operations teams prioritize automating workflows and reducing](https://thenewstack.io/use-low-code-to-reduce-friction-for-cloud-operations-teams/)bottlenecks. One operations manager at a technology company explained: “I am in charge of everything CLM. And our legal counsel does more with the law itself.”**Cloud Cost Optimization**: With cloud spending projected to reach $597 billion in 2023, according to[Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-04-19-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-in-2023), finance teams need programmatic access to contract data to manage costs effectively.
**Building Contract Pipelines**
The most successful implementations I’ve observed follow Infrastructure as Code patterns familiar to DevOps teams:

**Contract Repository as Source of Truth**: Similar to a git repository, all agreements are stored in a centralized,[versioned system that becomes the single](https://thenewstack.io/nvm-manage-multiple-versions-of-node-js-on-a-single-system/)source of truth.**Contract Templates as Configuration**: Standard agreements are templatized with variables that can be automatically populated based on system parameters, similar to how infrastructure templates work.**Approval Workflows as Pipeline Gates**: Just as code must pass tests before deployment, contracts require specific approval workflows that can be automated and audited.**Contract Events as Triggers**: Expirations, renewals, and amendments generate events that trigger downstream automation in monitoring and provisioning systems.
**The AI Contract Agent Pattern**
The newest pattern emerging is using AI to bridge human contracts with machine-readable APIs. These AI contract agents can:

- Extract key terms and obligations from legal text and convert them to structured data
- Create
[machine-readable representations of compliance](https://thenewstack.io/a-call-to-use-generative-ai-to-create-more-trustworthy-data/)requirements - Monitor both software behavior and contract terms to identify discrepancies
For example, one e-commerce company uses AI to automatically track [API rate limits](https://thenewstack.io/how-nuanced-rate-limiting-transforms-your-api-and-business/) across hundreds of vendor contracts and dynamically adjust their provisioning to stay within contractual boundaries while maximizing available resources.

**Implementation Challenges**
The contract-as-code approach faces several challenges:

**Data Extraction**: Converting existing PDF contracts into structured data remains difficult, requiring either manual work or sophisticated AI. According to[Fynk](https://fynk.com/en/blog/contract-management-statistics-trends/), AI is expected to be embedded in 90% of enterprise software by 2025, which should help address this challenge.**Organizational Silos**: Legal, finance, and engineering teams often use separate tools with minimal integration.**Security Concerns**: Contract[data contains sensitive business information that requires careful access](https://thenewstack.io/deploy-mongodb-in-a-container-access-it-outside-the-cluster/)control, similar to the challenges of code repositories.
**Getting Started**
For DevOps teams looking to start this journey, I recommend three initial steps:

**API-First Contract Tools**: Choose contract management systems with robust APIs that integrate with existing DevOps workflows.**Cross-Functional Ownership**: Create a contract working group with legal, finance, and engineering representatives.**Start Small**: Begin by automating notifications for critical contract events before moving to deeper integration.
**Conclusion**
As cloud native architectures mature, treating business contracts as code becomes essential for maintaining velocity. Successful organizations will break down the artificial boundary between technical contracts (APIs) and business contracts (legal agreements), creating unified systems where all obligations and dependencies are visible, trackable, and automatable.

The future belongs to companies where finance, legal, and engineering speak a common contractual language, with machines handling the translation.
