We rely more than ever on digital technology for the services we use daily. At the same time, those services experience more frequent disruptions, with incidents affecting customers increasing [12.5%](https://www.pagerduty.com/assets/2024/State%20of%20Digital%20Operations%202024.pdf) year on year.

Incidents usually start with a faulty push, cyberattack or a lapse in the digital plumbing. And regulators? They’ve definitely noticed the surge in outages. In response, they’re rolling out more rules to boost resilience because when essential services like banking, education or health care go down, the ripple effect can be massive. One outage can quickly snowball, taking down other critical systems that run on the same technology foundations.

In Europe, the EU has launched the [NIS2 Directive](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive) and the [Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en), and in the UK, a new [Cyber Security and Resilience Bill](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cyber-security-and-resilience-bill) is forthcoming later in 2025. What these regulations have in common is a demand that organizations increase digital operational resilience, including implementing strict processes for reporting incidents quickly.

However, putting the required processes into place poses significant challenges.

[Manually collating the information needed to report an incident](https://thenewstack.io/move-away-from-manual-with-automated-incident-response/) across a complex technology stack is no easy feat, especially when the initial report must be submitted within 24 hours of the incident occurring, as is the case with the NIS2 Directive and the UK’s Cyber Security and Resilience Bill.
For these regulations, organizations are given 28 days to submit an investigative report consisting of multiple elements, including root cause analysis, audit trail, documentation of actions and communications, impact assessment and guidance around how future incidents will be avoided.

Regulators are also becoming less patient. For incidents found to have a significant impact — defined by the [NIS2 directive](https://www.nis-2-directive.com/NIS_2_Directive_Article_23.html) as “capable of causing severe operational disruption of the services or financial loss” — regulators can demand a complete investigation report to be delivered within one month, as well as intermediate reports, on request, where the impact of an incident is ongoing.

The only way organizations can keep up and stay [resilient is by leaning into AI-powered](https://thenewstack.io/ai-powered-automation-is-critical-to-it-resilience-and-adaptability/), automation-driven digital operations in a single, unified platform. Juggling fragmented tools just isn’t cutting it anymore.

Here are five ways a unified approach enables IT and digital teams to maintain compliance and enhance operational resiliency.

**1. Simplify Service Ownership and Reduce Manual Toil**
A unified platform makes service ownership a no-brainer by directly connecting critical services to the right responders so there’s no scrambling when things go sideways. Teams can set up services quickly and at scale, making it easier to get a real-time pulse on system health and see just how far the damage spreads when something breaks. Instead of chasing down data across a dozen monitoring tools, everything is centralized in one place for easy analysis. With automation handling the tedious diagnostics, teams can spend less time on manual grunt work and more time actually fixing the problem.

**2. Enable Prompt, Accurate Reporting and Info Sharing**
With all data centralized in a unified platform, the classification and reporting of incidents is far easier with accessible and detailed incident logs that provide a clear audit trail. Sophisticated platforms also integrate with IT service management (ITSM) and IT operations (ITOps) tools to simplify the reporting of incidents based on predefined criteria. The pressure typically placed upon responders is further lifted with automated runbooks for rapid reporting and generative AI capabilities that can produce status updates for public pages associated with an incident.

**3. Consistent Resiliency Testing and Learning Experiences**
Every incident, both real and simulated, should be viewed as a learning opportunity. Aggregating data from disparate tools into a single location gives teams a full picture of how their organization’s operations have been affected and supplies a narrative for reporting. Teams can then uncover patterns across tools, [teams and time to drive continuous learning](https://thenewstack.io/what-can-incident-teams-learn-from-crisis-management/) in post-incident reviews. Coupled with regular, automated testing of disaster recovery runbooks, teams can build greater confidence in their system’s resilience.

**4. Strengthen Visibility Into External Partner Risks**
Organizations must be aware of risks posed by critical third-party providers (CTTPs) for compliance. If a CTTP like a cloud provider, cybersecurity contractor or data hosting provider experiences their own incident, the consequences for the organization — ranging from data loss to operational disruption — can be serious. A unified digital operations management platform mitigates risk through rapid categorization and reporting of incidents by the originating provider so organizations retain oversight. With in-built automated testing, teams can also check the availability and service quality of CTTPs for early warning signs.

**5. Streamline Documentation and Record Management**
Keeping detailed records isn’t just a compliance box to check. It’s a lifesaver when audits roll around. A unified platform that syncs both ways with IT service management tools and plays nicely with Slack and Microsoft Teams means every response and conversation is automatically logged (no more copying and pasting notes at 2 a.m.). This makes meeting both real-time and follow-up reporting requirements a breeze. Plus, embedded AI can summarize key actions and chats so teams can quickly update execs and partners without sifting through endless message threads.

**Build Regulation Readiness**
Organizations need to stay ahead of the curve (and the regulators) to keep up with incoming rules and regulations. The key to succeeding is arming IT and digital teams with data at their fingertips so they can respond to regulators at lightning speed. The challenge for organizations is that the infrastructure supporting critical digital services has become much more complex to manage and secure.

The only real way to stay regulation-ready in this high-stakes, high-complexity world is with a unified platform that bakes AI and automation directly into operations. Because when it comes to compliance, scrambling at the last minute isn’t a strategy. It’s a disaster waiting to happen.
