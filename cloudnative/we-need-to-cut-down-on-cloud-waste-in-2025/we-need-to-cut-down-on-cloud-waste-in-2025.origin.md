Let’s face the facts: budgets are tight, and we are all trying to avoid the dreaded layoffs. Any type of waste is a budget killer; eliminating it has become priority number one. Cloud waste is an apparent offender, so how do we identify, eradicate, and strategize to avoid it in the future?

Cost optimization is at the heart of our work, but we also need to keep [user experience](https://thenewstack.io/why-the-user-experience-is-often-so-bad-and-how-to-fix-it/), application performance, and Service Level Expectations (SLEs) working in parallel. We can’t sacrifice reliability as we look to cut down on waste, and finding this balance is paramount to executing our work with a tight budget.

**Take Stock of the Situation**
Cloud computing has become increasingly important in engineering and tech innovation. In the last few years, around [60% of corporate data](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/corporate-cloud-data) has been stored on the cloud, which has increased. AI adoption has further spiked cloud use and costs, so it’s no surprise that FinOps has become more prominent.

However, [FinOps’ role has only become more complex with rising costs](https://thenewstack.io/hybrid-it-is-emerging-as-the-solution-to-ais-rising-cost/) and increased pressure to optimize on a new level. Waste is not, after all, a new issue, but it has become continuously more complex due to many factors, such as an increased use of multiple environments and providers. So, how can we begin to face this increasingly urgent problem?

**Identify Areas of Waste**
Scoping out the problem areas is the first step to eliminating them. To start, we [need to perform system](https://thenewstack.io/devs-need-system-design-tools-not-diagramming-tools/) audits. Deploy reliable monitors to [track how many resources are being used and which servers](https://thenewstack.io/cachet-the-open-source-status-page-system-for-tracking-servers/) often remain idle or overrun. Taking stock from a resource standpoint can paint a clear picture of the situation we must master.

Next, we need to approach the issue from a data standpoint. Monitoring ingress (data entering your cloud environment) and egress (data leaving your cloud environment) costs is essential for managing cloud expenses. Several cloud monitoring tools (such as [AWS CloudWatch](https://thenewstack.io/pros-and-cons-of-cloudwatch-for-error-monitoring/) and Azure Monitor) and application monitoring tools (such as Dyantrace and Datadog) are available to monitor cost and infrastructure metrics.

Finally, implement alerts on costs and usage to alert us to significant fluctuations. Once we understand where our money leaks through the cracks, we can begin to plug these holes.

**Searching for Solutions**
Acting proactively is one of the most critical aspects of financially-wise cloud management. One of the most common issues I’ve seen is organizations accepting a standardized cloud package and doing business. Even those taking significant steps in other areas have been surprised when they find out their overall spending isn’t optimized. In most cases, accepting standard packages isn’t worth the time it saves. Choose customization and pick the correct capacity size that custom fits the needs discovered through auditing. Standardization is the easy road that often leaves unused resources in its wake.

The employment of a multicloud strategy is becoming the new standard. This strategy offers many benefits, including flexibility, innovation, and cost optimization. In terms of cost efficiency, any method that increases customization is a win.

At the heart of this is the need to adjust our mindset. Since [FinOps is relatively new](https://thenewstack.io/finops-the-why-what-and-how/), it’s easy to assume that we’re already at the crux of innovation and become passive in our strategy. However, we must refuse to accept the status quo and continuously examine our processes and usage.

**When It Still Feels Like an Uphill Battle **
Despite having the proper technical methods, managing budget-friendly cloud systems can be a massive headache. One non-technical issue that can cause complications is a lack of smooth collaboration. FinOps, like many technical fields, increasingly relies on teamwork. [Working between the many teams, FinOps](https://thenewstack.io/finops-how-kubernetes-teams-can-best-work-with-finance/) affects requires communication and coordination by all parties involved, which can quickly become disrupted.

Prioritizing the optimization of teamwork and clear communication can ease hiccups that make every day an unnecessary burden. Initiate more check-ins, implement communication standards, choose a good collaboration platform, and examine where misunderstandings most often occur. Good collaboration is the basis of any good operation, and FinOps is undoubtedly no exception.

**Focus on Future-Proofing**
Like many business units, FinOps has experienced rapid evolution and is on a steady path to further change. [DevOps](https://thenewstack.io/the-what-why-and-how-of-devops/) has led to FinOps, and [AIOps](https://thenewstack.io/chatting-with-data-llms-are-transforming-aiops/) and beyond are waiting on the horizon. Financial efficiency will only [become more critical](https://thenewstack.io/software-developers-are-becoming-critical-members-in-the-us-space-force/) as the industry evolves; mastering these cost-focused measures now will pay back dividends. Cloudy skies are on the forecast; make sure you have your umbrella.
