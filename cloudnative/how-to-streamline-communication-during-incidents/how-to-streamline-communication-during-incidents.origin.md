In 2024, the cost of hourly downtime exceeded [$300,000 for 90% of organizations](https://www.calyptix.com/wp-content/uploads/Hourly-Cost-of-Downtime-ITIC.pdf), while 41% said hourly downtime cost them $1 million to $5 million. Incidents disrupt business operations and revenue while irreparably damaging customer trust. Every second counts given these very high stakes, but all too often, poor communication slows remediation times and exacerbates the damage.

Successful incident management hinges on more than just fixing the issue at hand. It includes creating the ideal conditions for organizations to reduce the risk of potential failure through improved operations management. Every business is aware of the challenge of connecting their IT service management tool (ITSM) with their customer service team. ITSM is a great tool for organizing IT tickets and allowing them to be tracked and managed, but ITSM is often disconnected from the customer service team.

Streamlining communications between these two functions throughout the [incident life cycle](https://thenewstack.io/best-practices-for-mastering-the-incident-life-cycle/) is key in bolstering operations management. Without structured, consistent communication — both during [remediation](https://thenewstack.io/5-ways-to-supercharge-incident-remediation-with-automation/) and in the aftermath of an incident — customer service teams can be left unaware of an incident’s status, leaving customers locked out of crucial services.

Many service-level agreements (SLAs) require downtime to be limited to five minutes or less. When communication doesn’t flow between the engineering team and the customer service team, SLAs can be breached, which can result in penalties. This can easily happen as many engineers are laser-focused on the task at hand and may tell their manager that an incident is resolved but neglect to pass this information to the customer service team. One solution organizations can adopt is to automate their communications processes around incidents, eliminating the need for manual communications.

Here are three ways organizations can use AI and automation to streamline and enhance communication throughout the entire incident management life cycle and boost operational resilience.

**1. Use Automated Workflows to Reduce Responder Fatigue**
[Automation can be incredibly powerful](https://thenewstack.io/chaos-to-control-3-steps-for-automating-incident-management/) for streamlining incident management. For example, when diagnosing a software failure, engineers can waste valuable time manually running health checks, analyzing logs and troubleshooting. Process automation can trigger diagnostic and remediation actions instantly, reducing reliance on subject matter experts who should only be engaged for higher-priority tasks.
Organizations can use automation to help engineers provide customer service agents with status updates. This helps to ensure information flows through to customers, reducing their frustration and ensuring SLAs are maintained without creating extra work for engineers.

The growing role of AI agents will further accelerate resolution times and sharpen communication. AI-driven systems can analyze vast amounts of data, identify root causes and suggest or execute remediation actions. If the correct rules and governance are in place, AI agents can take proactive steps without human intervention, freeing up engineers for more strategic work.

**2. Standardize Communication Channels **
The use of multiple tools also can fragment incident management communication. Teams often miss messages or receive delayed updates due to jumping between messaging apps such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, emails, ticketing systems and various dashboards, and that’s if the information makes it out of the engineering silo at all. The lack of a single source of truth creates unnecessary confusion and knowledge gaps. At the same time, manual updates can easily be forgotten or missed during an incident.

A dedicated, unified communication platform for the entire incident management life cycle is needed to fix this fragmentation. Whether through Slack, Microsoft Teams or a centralized incident management platform, having a designated location for automated updates and coordination ensures clarity and consistency.

Centralized communication is even more effective when enhanced by AI-powered summarization tools. AI can extract key insights from lengthy chat logs, highlight critical updates, and provide a concise overview of status and progress. Instead of wasting time scrolling through endless threads, engineers can instantly access the information they need, and customer service agents can obtain summaries of an incident’s status.

AI can also identify patterns in communication and surface relevant historical incidents that may provide insight into the current issue. Pattern recognition is particularly helpful during post-incident learning reviews, where AI tools can summarize actions taken during an incident and outline key learnings and process improvements that can be implemented moving forward.

The most successful organizations will also embed escalation into their workflows. When an incident needs executive input, AI can route updates in real time to deliver visibility to decision-makers without disrupting operations teams with unnecessary questions.

**3. Automate Customer Updates to Maintain Trust **
When services go down, customers expect immediate transparency. Delayed or vague communication damages trust and can push customers toward competitors. Manually drafting status updates, emailing affected users and keeping internal teams aligned is a time-consuming burden for engineers and customer service teams on the front lines of an incident.

AI-powered communication tools can generate status updates and estimated resolution times on behalf of engineers, helping to keep customers informed without requiring manual intervention from engineers for each update.

However, while AI can streamline communication workflows, a human-in-the-loop approach remains essential. AI-generated messages should always be reviewed to ensure accuracy and maintain a tone that conveys empathy and reassurance. The best approach balances AI’s efficiency with human expertise to ensure clear and customer-friendly communication.

**Future-Proofing Incident Management**
Incident management doesn’t end when the issue is resolved. Post-incident reviews are critical for analyzing what worked well and identifying areas for improvement, including how information was able to flow from engineers to customer service teams and how this communication helped or hindered the response. Continuous refinement helps to shorten response times, meet SLA targets and enhance service reliability.

Effective communication is all about enabling teams to work together and fix problems better. By incorporating AI and automation into the incident management life cycle, organizations can refine their communication strategies and help teams work faster toward driving operational excellence.
