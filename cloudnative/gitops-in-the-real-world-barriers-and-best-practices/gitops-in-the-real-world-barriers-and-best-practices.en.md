GitOps is critical for ensuring consistency, reliability and auditability in modern infrastructure management. By treating infrastructure changes as code, GitOps helps reduce configuration drift, simplify rollback and enhance traceability. In complex, distributed systems — especially [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/)-based environments — GitOps enforces strong operational discipline, enabling faster recovery, tighter security and more efficient collaboration between dev and ops teams.

But GitOps isn’t without challenges. That’s why [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) gathered real-world insights on adoption hurdles and best practices directly from the engineering teams implementing it.

Whether you’re new to GitOps or optimizing an existing implementation, join us on July 17 at 10:30 a.m. PST / 1:30 p.m. EST for a special online event, **[The State of GitOps 2025: Key findings and what they mean to you](https://streamyard.com/watch/8CXf6rNGSsrv)**.

During this free webinar, Octopus Deploy leaders [Bob Walker, Field CTO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobjwalker/), and [Dan Garfield, VP of Open Source](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-garfield/), and TNS host [Chris Pirillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrispirillo/) showcase the results of the inaugural **[State of GitOps Report](https://octopus.com/publications/state-of-gitops-report)**. Based on insights from over 600 DevOps and platform engineers, it’s the industry’s first study to deeply examine how real-world teams are using GitOps, what’s driving success and where organizations are falling short.
