[Percona](https://www.percona.com/?utm_content=inline+mention), which provides enterprise support for open source database systems such as [MongoDB](https://thenewstack.io/mongodb-8-goes-hard-on-time-series-data-horizontal-scaling/) and [MySQL](https://thenewstack.io/oracle-support-for-mysql-5-7-ends-soon-key-upgrades-in-8-0/), has expanded its portfolio to also support the open source [Valkey in-memory data store](https://valkey.io/) as well, the company announced Tuesday.
The support plan, [Percona Support for Valkey](https://www.percona.com/valkey/support-and-services), is a comprehensive service for 24/7 support of [Valkey deployments](https://thenewstack.io/valkey-will-not-just-be-a-redis-retread/). It comes in two forms: one for production and another “premium” offering for critical applications that may need immediate help when things go awry.

For those already on Redis, [from which Valkey was forked last year](https://thenewstack.io/navigating-the-path-from-redis-to-valkey/), the company also offers [Valkey Migration](https://www.percona.com/resources/valkey-migration) services to help with the transition, should they wish to go that route.

“The almost immediate explosion of interest and support for [Valkey](https://thenewstack.io/valkey-a-redis-fork-with-a-future/) goes beyond just the technology itself,” said Peter Zaitsev, co-founder at Percona, in a statement. “It wasn’t simply a matter of companies looking to control costs. It was an expression of widespread dissatisfaction and frustration that people are feeling with self-proclaimed ‘open source’ software vendors suddenly deciding to abandon the model.”

## Open Source Valkey
Valkey was created as [a direct response](https://thenewstack.io/linux-foundation-forks-the-open-source-redis-as-valkey/) to Redis’s decision to change the licensing model of its namesake data store, moving away from an open source license in favor of the Redis Source Available License (RSALv2) and the Server Side Public License (SSPLv1).

“Redis never moved this fast,” said [Martin Visser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinrvisser/), Percona tech lead for Valkey, in an interview with TNS, noting the second major release of Valkey, version 8.1., is due to be released soon.

The project attracted engineering help from major tech players, including [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) (AWS), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?utm_content=inline+mention), Ericsson — and from Percona itself.

[Valkey version 8.0](https://thenewstack.io/valkey-whats-new-and-whats-next/), which came out in September, was the first major release that advanced the original codebase in significant ways, including multicore utilization and asynchronous I/O threading, which were two long-sought-after features that improved performance considerably, according to the project.
## Commercial Support
Those wishing to use the software — or migrate their current version of Redis over — will likely need some commercial support, Visser noted.

Like any open source software, organizations can certainly run Valkey in-house, though there will be issues that they will run into that will be difficult to mitigate without some serious engineering help, including inefficient key-value store configurations, high-latency operations, complex migrations and misconfigured settings, the company warned.

A Percona survey found that 75% of Redis users are either testing, considering or have already adopted Valkey, and 76% are planning to utilize third-party enterprise support.

## New Frontier for Percona
Going forward, Percona will dedicate engineering resources to enhancing Valkey’s programmability, as well as offer security enhancements and bug fixes.

The company has no plans of launching its own distribution, like it did for MongoDB and MySQL, but contribute features directly upstream, Visser explained.
