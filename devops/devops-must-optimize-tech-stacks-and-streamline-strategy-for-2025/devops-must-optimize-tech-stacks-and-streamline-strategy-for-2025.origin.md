It’s not an easy time to be a developer. Due to ongoing talent shortages and budgetary constraints, developers are tasked with more responsibilities than ever. Meanwhile, the applications they work with are becoming more complex by the minute. To keep up in this highly dynamic environment, developers are also pressured to learn new tools, [programming languages](https://thenewstack.io/programming-languages/), and technologies, such as generative AI.

Amidst these factors, every DevOps team must scrutinize its processes and technology stack before the new year begins. Supporting developer productivity in this high-pressure environment requires the right combination of technology and strategy.

Here are a few tools and best practices DevOps should consider implementing to foster productivity, [improve the developer experience](https://thenewstack.io/improving-developer-experience-drives-profitability/), and drive innovation in 2025 and beyond:

**Leverage AI-Driven Tools — Mindfully — To Empower Devs**
AI-powered tools, particularly GenAI tools, can offer substantial productivity gains when appropriately leveraged. For example, technologies like coding assistants have been shown to increase developer productivity by up to [45%](https://fortegrp.com/insights/ai-coding-assistants). In addition to helping with code generation, AI-driven tools can aid in application testing, anomaly detection and predictive maintenance, infrastructure optimization, and accelerating continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

However, DevOps must remember that AI-powered tools are not infallible. They make things like observability tools (more on this following) even more necessary for catching potential errors before they go into production. DevOps will increasingly need AI-powered tools to stay competitive, but there is still a strong need for human oversight. Finally, DevOps teams should be discerning about which — and how many — AI tools they introduce into their tech stack. AI only makes sense for specific use cases, and in some situations, introducing AI can create more [work for devs](https://thenewstack.io/gitlab-uses-ai-agents-to-automate-non-coding-dev-work/) (e.g., more code to review), so DevOps must weigh the costs and benefits carefully.

**Adopt Observability Tools To Enhance Productivity and Performance (and Save $$)**
Observability tools are crucial for enhancing developer productivity, improving application performance, and reducing costs for DevOps teams. These tools provide deep visibility, which supports [productivity by giving developers](https://thenewstack.io/atlassians-new-ai-product-gives-developers-access-to-agents/) end-to-end visibility into their applications and infrastructure. They also give developers insights into how everything is [performing so they can fine-tune and optimize](https://thenewstack.io/13-practical-updates-to-optimize-website-performance/) their systems as needed.

Additionally, observability tools help developers take a proactive approach to performance by rapidly identifying and remediating application issues, reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR), and supporting overall application performance. Observability tools save DevOps teams time and money by identifying inefficiencies and reducing application downtime.

**Implement Platform Engineering To Streamline DevOps**
Platform [engineering creates and maintains internal developer platforms to streamline software](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering-reshapes-software-dev-at-bechtle/) development. It helps developers automate their workflows, standardize their tools, and offer self-service capabilities to spend more time building features and less time managing infrastructure. The benefits of this strategy are plentiful, so it’s no surprise that platform engineering adoption is on the rise and expected to be implemented in [80%](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/platform-engineering/what-is-platform-engineering) of engineering organizations by 2026.

Now is the time for DevOps teams to solidify their platform engineering strategy to improve the developer experience and boost productivity. As a first step, they should take inventory of the dev’s most significant pain points to determine the problems the platform will address — whether it’s related to tool selection and management or infrastructure. From there, they can evaluate the decisions, tools, and infrastructure components of the platform and assess their current tooling and workflows to determine areas for standardization and improvement. The ultimate goal is to build consistent workflows and practices that supercharge productivity and uphold software quality.

In today’s demanding and rapidly [evolving business landscape](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-security-report-evolving-landscape-of-devsecops/), productivity is the name of the game. Empowering developers begins with DevOps teams deliberately approaching their processes, tools, and strategy. DevOps teams can thrive despite growing pressures by adopting AI-powered solutions (mindfully), observability tools, and [implementing platform engineering](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-implement-innersource-with-an-internal-developer-portal/). As organizations prepare for the future, these investments will enhance the developer experience, drive efficiency, and maintain a competitive edge.
