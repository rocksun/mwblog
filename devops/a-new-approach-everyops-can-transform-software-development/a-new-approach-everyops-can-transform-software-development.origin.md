As software development evolves alongside advancing technology, the concept of “EveryOps” emerges as a transformative force in 2025, encompassing [DevOps](https://thenewstack.io/devops/), [DevSecOps](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-devsecops/), [MLOps](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-mlops/) and more. EveryOps redefines the software development process while addressing current limitations and future needs.

**The Current Landscape of Software Development**
Software development is nonlinear, moving from basic applications to advanced ones, and encompasses tools like observability and [CI/CD](https://thenewstack.io/ci-cd/). While some companies maintain a streamlined approach, larger enterprises may find themselves facing challenges, with a bloated software stack creating overlaps and silos, and no clear and visible lineage for how software releases are delivered.

This fragmentation highlights the need for a new approach to bring together developers for DevOps, security professionals for DevSecOps and machine learning (ML) experts for MLOps across the organization. In this context, EveryOps provides a holistic framework for organizations to make sense of the complexities of the operational landscape.

**EveryOps: A New Approach**
EveryOps focuses on building trusted software through a factory model that mirrors the software supply chain. Organizations must ensure their software components are trustworthy for compliance managers, CISOs and customers. This model emphasizes automation, robust policies for trustworthiness and comprehensive control over the software development life cycle.

An effective EveryOps implementation is founded on an open, API-driven system, allowing organizations to adopt and integrate various aspects of quality and control gates along the software supply chain.

**The Importance of EveryOps**
The DevSecOps approach enhances developer productivity through integrated security practices throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC), reducing vulnerabilities and accelerating high-quality software delivery. However, the increasing [complexity of software development](https://thenewstack.io/is-ai-the-antidote-to-software-development-complexity/) — especially with AI, ML and generative AI — highlights the need for a broader, unifying framework like EveryOps.

Traditionally, [MLOps has operated](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-mlops/) in isolation, catering primarily to data scientists and engineers. With the blurring of boundaries between DevSecOps and MLOps, integrating these domains becomes essential for managing complexities effectively.

**Building Unity With EveryOps**
EveryOps represents a paradigm shift, and emphasizes the [need to bridge gaps between DevSecOps and MLOps](https://thenewstack.io/for-ai-to-succeed-mlops-needs-a-bridge-to-devops/) teams. This holistic approach integrates security, accountability and collaboration across all workflows, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and end-to-end responsibility. Successfully implementing EveryOps requires tools designed for cross-collaboration, allowing data scientists and engineers to work together seamlessly. Key aspects like model training, data preprocessing and CI/CD pipelines must be aligned to create a transparent, automated ML life cycle.

**Benefits of EveryOps Adoption**
Organizations that embrace EveryOps can expect several key benefits:

- Enhanced trust: A unified visibility of ML workflows allows stakeholders to rely on AI system outputs confidently.
- Improved efficiency: Streamlined, automated processes reduce friction, enabling faster cycles and collaboration.
- Scalability and resilience: Effective practices ensure scalable software and ML systems with robust security.
- Cultural alignment: Breaking down silos fosters end-to-end responsibility and drives innovation.
**A Strategic Necessity**
EveryOps is not merely a trend; it’s reshaping software development by uniting various operational frameworks under one cohesive strategy. By prioritizing trust, visibility and automated controls, organizations can deliver secure, reliable and scalable solutions.

Adopting EveryOps is imperative for organizations seeking to remain competitive. By bridging gaps and fostering alignment, teams are empowered to thrive amid the complexities of modern software and new ML workflows. The transition to EveryOps is essential for future-ready organizations aiming for agility, [security and success in a rapidly evolving landscape](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-security-report-evolving-landscape-of-devsecops/).
