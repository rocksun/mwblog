I currently run several engineering teams in FinTech. Our work involves large distributed systems and strict requirements. Although I started using more “traditional” processes, I eventually discovered Agile and user stories.

Honestly, the first time I heard about user stories, they sounded too simple. Yet, once I tried them, I realized they bring clarity and reduce team confusion.

In this article, I’d like to share my perspective on user stories, why they matter, and how they fit into the broader Agile picture. I’ll also discuss the differences between Agile and Waterfall, explain how backlogs work, and show you how sprints organize everything. By the end of this blog post, you should have a good idea of how to use user stories effectively.

## A Quick Look at Agile’s Origins
Agile gained momentum in 2001 when a group of developers met in Utah to discuss better software-building methods. They realized traditional methods often locked teams into plans that were hard to change, even if new information surfaced. The Agile Manifesto emerged from that meeting. It values working software, team collaboration, and openness to evolving requirements.

Many approaches — like [Scrum](https://justanothertechlead.com/agile/scrum-events-a-tech-leads-guide-to-effective-scrum/) and Extreme Programming — grew out of these core ideas, emphasizing shorter cycles, frequent feedback, and minor, functional releases.

## What Are User Stories?
A user story is a quick statement that tells you who needs something, what they need, and why it’s valuable. You can usually spot it by the sentence structure:

“As a [type of user], I want [action], so I can [goal].”

For example: “As a frequent shopper, I want to save my payment details to check out faster next time.”

That single sentence highlights the user (a frequent shopper), the action (save payment details), and the reason (faster checkout). It forces you to consider the user’s goal before pursuing design or technical details.

### Why Are User Stories So Useful?
If you write a user story well, the team immediately sees which person they’re helping and what problem they’re solving. This connects the Engineers with the Customer and ensures they deliver what is needed. User stories encourage a more user-focused mindset.

### User Stories Simplify Planning
You can break extensive features into smaller user stories. In addition, you can prioritize these stories based on which goals matter most.

Moreover, if business needs change, you can easily reorder them in the backlog.

### User Stories Spark Better Conversations
Teams can discuss each story and determine whether they understand it. Furthermore, testers and [developers can raise questions about edge cases](https://thenewstack.io/handling-edge-cases-and-exceptions-in-python/) to clarify everything before coding starts.

### Adding Acceptance Criteria
User stories tend to remain high-level, but acceptance criteria bring in specifics. Think of them as a checklist that clarifies how to confirm the story is done. For instance, if your user story says:

“As a visitor, I want to sign up for a weekly newsletter so I can stay informed about new products,”

The acceptance criteria might look like this:

- The system only accepts valid email addresses.
- A user sees a confirmation of successful sign-up.
- The system sends a welcome message to the new subscriber.
With these points in place, [developers and testers know what success](https://thenewstack.io/mindset-refactor-evolving-for-developer-success/) looks like. The product owner can also see if anything is missing and add more details.

### Building and Maintaining a Backlog
A backlog is where you store all your user stories, bug reports, and ideas for future improvements. The product owner (or whoever manages your backlog) orders these items so the highest-value tasks appear at the top.

For example, if I’m working on an online marketplace, a top-priority story might say:

“As a seller, I want to list my products quickly to reach more potential buyers.”

Items lower in the backlog might involve optional features or tasks that can wait until after the core product is stable.

The team will also refine these items, adding acceptance criteria or clarifying details. This process, often called “backlog grooming,” ensures that it’s clear enough to work on a story whenever your team is ready to work on a story.

## Sprint: A Collection of User Stories
A sprint is a short period — often two weeks — where the team selects a few stories from the backlog and commits to finishing them. Typically, this involves:

### Sprint Planning
The product owner presents the highest-priority items. The team then asks questions, estimates effort, and decides how many stories to manage.

### Active Work
The team builds, tests, and reviews each story during the sprint. They also track progress using a board or tool that shows which stories are “to do,” “in progress,” or “done.”

### Sprint Review
Ultimately, the team shows the completed stories to stakeholders, who can provide feedback or request changes. This might lead to new or updated stories in the backlog.

### Retrospective
The team reflects on [how the sprint went](https://justanothertechlead.com/agile/sprint-review-vs-retrospective-a-real-world-guide-to-the-difference/). Were there any blockers? Could they improve their processes? This continuous improvement cycle is a key part of Agile.

## A Few Common Pitfalls
### Vague Stories
A statement like, “As a user, I want to do stuff,” doesn’t guide the team — clarity matters. Ensure that you follow the “As a [Type of user] when I [perform a specific action], I [get an outcome].

For example, “As an Admin user, when I correctly enter my username and password and log in, I am redirected to the admin console.”

### Overly Detailed Stories
Conversely, if you cram too many technical details into one story, you might [lose sight of the primary user](https://thenewstack.io/stop-losing-users-the-load-balancing-fix-your-website-needs/) goal. Keep the story itself brief, and store deeper notes elsewhere.

You don’t want: “As a user who is logged in but not an admin user, when I enter the admin URL and try to access it, I am shown the error message “You do not have privileges to view this resource” in bold, red, italic text which is converted to the local language and remains on the screen for the duration that the user is there.”

This is too long and convoluted.

You want: “As a standard user, I am shown an error when I try to access the admin console.”

Leave the rest of the details to the acceptance criteria.

### Forgetting Acceptance Criteria
If you skip the acceptance criteria, you may not know when the story is complete. Also, testers [won’t have a straightforward way to verify the work](https://thenewstack.io/genai-wont-work-until-you-nail-these-4-fundamentals/).

### Merging Multiple Goals
“As a customer, I want to track orders, update my profile, and request refunds.” These are three separate needs, and splitting them up simplifies testing and completion.

## Final Notes
Moving from rigid processes to Agile, I found user stories simple to understand but hard to master. Sometimes, my teams wrote user stories that were too broad or too narrowly focused on code. Over the years, we have learned that the best user stories sound like users talking about what they want to accomplish without delving into deep technical details.

I also discovered that acceptance criteria serve as a gentle safety net. They ensure that everyone (developers, testers, and product owners) agrees on what the story must do before it’s considered “done.” This alignment reduces misunderstandings and late-stage surprises.

[User stories are a straightforward way to keep](https://thenewstack.io/prototype-the-path-to-keep-user-experiences-front-and-center/) software projects on track. They shift the conversation away from technical tasks and toward real user goals. Acceptance criteria offer measurable targets for each story, while Agile practices like sprints and frequent reviews create regular opportunities to check in with stakeholders.
Your backlog organizes everything and helps you decide which stories to tackle next. Once a sprint begins, your team can focus on just a few stories, deliver working software, and collect valuable feedback.
