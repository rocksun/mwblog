As organizations increasingly rely on digital tools and solutions to increase efficiency and profitability, the demand for developers’ time has never been higher. With many organizations in a continuous cycle of new product releases or patching vulnerabilities, developers are under significant pressure to deliver a high output of work on tight deadlines. This can create substantial stress during crunch moments for tech talent that is already overloaded.

As product demand increases, the workload placed on developers grows. In fact, a [recent survey](https://www.harness.io/state-of-developer-experience) revealed that 52% of developers cited burnout as a reason that their developer peers leave their jobs. It has become critical for organizations to simplify and refine their [DevOps pipeline](https://thenewstack.io/devops/) and processes to improve the overall developer experience and reduce work-related stress.

**1. Embracing Secure by Design**
Organizations must ensure that their DevOps pipeline is aligned with CI/CD to deliver stable and secure software. [CI/CD principles](https://thenewstack.io/ci-cd/) help software development teams create, test and deploy applications more efficiently, often through automation.

Additionally, embracing a “secure by design” mentality and shifting [security testing “left” in development cycles](https://thenewstack.io/security-testing-must-be-part-of-software-development-life-cycle/) can help developers reduce the need for firefighting later in the product life cycle. By placing an increased emphasis on securing and testing code earlier in development cycles, developers can significantly reduce the need for stressful, time-consuming war rooms to resolve critical incidents.

The adoption of automation can help developers take this one step further. Automating processes such as regression testing and unit testing means multiple scripts can be launched at once, and tests can run in batches. This allows for faster feedback loops, and frees up developers’ time to accelerate software delivery and focus on higher-value tasks.

**2. Tackling Toolchain Complexity**
Through each stage of the software development cycle, specialized tools like GitHub and Jenkins are commonly deployed to improve the speed and accuracy of software delivery. Although these tools enable developers to work more effectively when organizations adopt a variety of tools, their flexibility sometimes becomes a detriment as knowledge becomes siloed.

Many organizations, particularly small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), depend heavily on the knowledge of a small number of people. This presents a significant challenge when these individuals are unavailable or leave. It also creates difficulties when new members join a team, as they often become dependent on more knowledgeable colleagues, which can increase workload and complexity while limiting the spread of knowledge.

Introducing an [internal developer platform (IDP) ](https://thenewstack.io/the-hidden-benefits-of-internal-developer-platforms/)provides one potential solution by acting as a single space for developers to test new software in a secure and compliant environment. From there, all developers within an organization can work according to standards on internal problems with clearly defined parameters, leading to consistency in existing processes. This enables developers to focus on building and deploying [code without worrying about infrastructure](https://thenewstack.io/why-infrastructure-as-code-is-vital-for-modern-devops/) and toolchain management, and offers them the freedom to innovate within set limits.

**3. Developer Platforms: Outsourced or Self-Managed?**
Developer platforms provide significant benefits for organizations at every stage of the software development pipeline. By setting standards for developers to adhere to, these platforms can streamline workflows and enhance collaboration, which drives improved productivity. Organizations should consider the following factors before jumping into full-scale deployment:

**Speed and agility:**Outsourced platforms offer faster setup, while self-managed platforms can take longer.**Customization:**Self-managed platforms offer businesses more control and flexibility in their environment, enabling them to meet specific business needs.**Scalability:**Outsourced platforms can easily scale their services up or down as they are cloud native, while self-managed platforms require manual intervention to adjust service scaling.**Support and maintenance:**Outsourced platforms come with built-in support, whereas self-managed platforms require in-house expertise to maintain.
Choosing the right developer platform is no easy decision, but evaluating each of these factors can help narrow down the platform that will provide the most benefit.

**4. A More Collaborative Approach**
In many cases, developers work in silos and are given tasks to complete without the full context of infrastructure and integration requirements. This can cause significant delays and process inefficiencies.

However, by [breaking down these barriers](https://thenewstack.io/breaking-down-the-barriers-to-operational-innovation/) between teams, organizations can create a culture of shared responsibility and continuous improvement. Increased cross-functional communication ensures every department aligns on its goals, workflows and processes. As an increasing number of teams collaborate, challenges can be identified and resolved faster, which all contribute to giving developers a smoother pipeline to ship good code.

This [process can be accelerated by deploying AI and automation](https://thenewstack.io/five-ways-process-automation-can-streamline-itops/) tools. Developers can use automation tools to send messages across teams using set templates, saving a significant amount of time. Generative AI can also generate status updates, providing different departments — including key internal and external stakeholders — visibility into the progress of each task. This allows teams to share feedback quickly and receive immediate support. As all departments become aligned, miscommunication is minimized and problem-solving becomes faster.

**Easing Developers’ Workload**
Developers are the backbone of the digital economy, and as businesses increasingly rely on new services and software, their importance will only increase. However, in an already-complex environment with high client demands and tight deadlines, developers are under significant pressure to innovate. Implementing solutions that reduce developers’ reliance on manual processes will be the key to reducing pressure.

Technologies such as AI will allow developers to focus on delivering value and reduce manual toil, allowing developers to unleash their creative potential and become better equipped to deliver innovative technology.
