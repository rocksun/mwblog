When it comes to [DevOps](https://thenewstack.io/devops/), being able to release software quickly is critical. Testing is essential to releasing, a task developers must perform frequently and promptly. The goal is to pinpoint and resolve bugs before a release hits production, triaging what software is ready to advance or if it should be junked altogether.

This is why incorporating [a test phase](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-testops-drawing-parallels-to-devops/) into the development processes is essential. But to do it right, you need automated tools, which depend upon the app. JUnit or Jest have proven effective for code and component unit tests. Newman does well with API public methods. Cypress performs best on end-to-end tests (E2E). To keep stakeholders in the loop, TestRail’s reporting provides automated updates on progress.

Further, testing can no longer be the realm of Quality Assurance (QA) alone. Engineering should not only be involved; they must share accountability. This structure reliably delivers the best results when correcting problems immediately before investing considerable time and money. Not only can testing fuel [continuous software delivery](https://thenewstack.io/continuous-delivery-gold-standard-for-software-development/), but using automation can take human error entirely out of the equation.

**Conceptual Thinking**
The [Test Pyramid](https://thenewstack.io/is-the-testing-pyramid-broken/) is a framework used to guide software development processes. It comprises several testing layers aimed explicitly at functionality, performance, and reliability, and its effectiveness has been touted for various reasons.

[Unit Tests](https://thenewstack.io/unit-tests-are-overrated-rethinking-testing-strategies/) are easy to conduct because they focus on a single unit of work, either a method or component. They are low-cost and simple to conduct, providing a cost-efficient means to protect code quality. Doing these during the build stage is the best way to achieve maximum results.
There are also Integration and API Tests, which verify an application’s ability to integrate with systems. After all, if integration isn’t possible, the app would be grossly limited, and a customer would be hamstrung from the start.

Still, the most far-reaching of all is UI E2E testing. This requires fully integrating your systems, frontend to backend, database to networking. Not only do they require more time and maintenance, they are the most expensive of all. You need to pay particular attention to E2E tests: [Overprovisioning](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-avoid-overprovisioning-java-resources/) will result in high costs and turn the Test Pyramid on its head.

By conducting tests in this order (scaling from most minor to most significant), organizations can ensure their scope remains focused on the needed areas and that their costs and remits don’t accidentally scale up from the proper focus area, as for who handles what, developers should be assigned to writing unit and integration tests. At the same time, QA should take UI E2E testing. However, be sure the actual product owners provide the scenarios.

**A Developing Case**
Let’s examine an implementation example to see how readily available tools can perform testing. In this case, we’ll use [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) (AWS).

First, there’s AWS CodePipeline for fully [managed continuous delivery](https://thenewstack.io/managing-compliance-with-continuous-delivery/) that builds pipelines while orchestrating infrastructure and application updates. This works particularly well with their AWS CodeDeploy, CodeCommit, and CodeBuild offerings and major third-party action providers like GitHub. This enables AWS CodePipeline to deliver even more powerful capabilities.

For instance, a detection option can create pipelines tied to the source location of artifacts, making short orders of tasks from function descriptions to risk assessments. A disabled transition feature can also link pipeline phases automatically, enabled by default. If you don’t want to advance to the next phase, click “disable transition,” and the pipeline activity will be halted.

AWS CodePipeline lets users edit a pipeline to bring in new stages, provide updates, or eliminate a stage. Also, an Edit page lets you add actions serially or alongside current activities, adding flexibility that enables a pipeline to grow quickly. There’s even an approval function for improved pipeline management, allowing automatic stopping activities if specific approval has not yet been given.

**You Can’t Cheat On Testing**
There’s no excuse for an untested app ever to be released. Seek out those tools that automate processes and eliminate the risk of human error. Further, remember to make [testing a shared responsibility in your organization](https://thenewstack.io/how-the-worlds-top-organizations-test/) and part of your culture.

You can’t cheat on testing, and neither would you want to — you need to pass, or you’re going to fail big. Bulletproof offerings never fail to attract customers and deliver better profit margins.
