Having attended Sprint Review meetings for over 15 years, I’ve seen both highly productive sessions that drive alignment and progress — and ones that feel like a frustrating waste of time.

When done right, Sprint Reviews keep teams on course, provide critical stakeholder feedback, and reinforce trust in the Scrum process. However, when handled poorly, they lead to disengagement, confusion, and missed opportunities for improvement.

In this guide, I’ll [walk you through practical steps to run](https://thenewstack.io/crawl-walk-run-the-key-to-successful-automation/) a Sprint Review that not only showcases progress but also fosters collaboration, drives meaningful discussions, and keeps your project moving in the right direction.

## Understanding the Sprint Review
The Sprint Review is usually the first meeting on the last day of the Sprint. In my experience, It Is held first, and then the scrum team conducts its [Sprint Retrospective](https://justanothertechlead.com/agile/sprint-review-vs-retrospective-a-real-world-guide-to-the-difference/).

The purpose of the Sprint Reviews is for the engineers to show the work they’ve completed within the sprint to any stakeholders. The stakeholders can then give feedback on that work, and everyone can discuss whether the sprint goals were hit and whether the work is on target.

Sure, you can tell the stakeholders you’ve completed some work, but demonstrating the work is always easier to understand and builds more confidence that the project is on track.

## Who Should Participate?
Anyone interested in the project should be invited.

While the Scrum team is the core attendee, others, such as Sales, Senior Management, additional Scrum teams, and Project Managers, can also benefit from attending.

If someone can provide insights or gain value from the meeting, they should attend it.

## Preparing for a Successful Review
To ensure a well-run session, presenters must be well-prepared.

Live demonstrations can be unpredictable, so I always recommend that presenters record the demos of their work beforehand and show the videos instead.

Also, the person running the meeting should organize demos on related topics. Grouping demos minimizes context switching and streamlines the meeting’s flow.

## During the Review
[Engineers present completed work to the Scrum team](https://thenewstack.io/continuous-improvement-metrics-for-scaling-engineering-teams/) and stakeholders during the Sprint Review. After each presentation, participants can ask questions and share feedback.
Questions can focus on technical details or how the work aligns with business objectives.

Though everyone is encouraged to contribute, the main presenters are typically engineers. This allows for focused discussions, with input from Product, QA, and [Business Analysts as needed](https://thenewstack.io/5-signs-your-business-needs-an-operations-intervention/).

## Example Sprint Review Format
Consider a six-engineer team working on different components:

**Presentation Order:**
- Daniel: Implements account lockout after five failed login attempts, requiring a password reset.
- Stephen: Introduces a “Forgot Password” functionality, emailing reset links.
- Lara: Enhances reporting to log “User Exceeded Max Login Attempts” events.
- Romesh: Adds logging for “User Clicked Forgot Password” actions.
- Elisa: Optimizes the reporting dashboard for faster load times.
- Owain: Enables combined
[event tracking for streamlined data](https://thenewstack.io/how-event-processing-builds-business-speed-and-agility/)insights.
Grouping similar topics keeps the discussion cohesive. For instance, Login Page updates are presented first, followed by reporting improvements, and lastly, the two performance-related stories are shown.

Stakeholders may ask clarifying questions, like why *five* login attempts were chosen before an account locks. There may or may not be a decision regarding whether this is the correct number within the meeting. Typically, you would organize a follow-up after the meeting to make a decision.

The reason for gathering so many people from different teams and departments is not only to show progress but also to get feedback from a wide variety of people, all of whom have different experiences.

For example, someone in the room may ask why we use the traditional Username and Password paradigm and not the “magic email link” login method.

These types of questions and comments make the Sprint Review so helpful. You are getting feedback early enough in the projection allows you to make changes before it’s too late.

## Best Practices for an Effective Sprint Review
### Demonstrate Real Progress
Rather than relying on slides, showcase functional deliverables. A working feature demo is far more engaging than screenshots.

### Foster Open Feedback
Encourage active participation by inviting questions and discussions. Document stakeholder feedback and determine whether adjustments should be incorporated into the backlog.

### Keep It Structured and Concise
A well-organized Sprint Review should follow this format:

- Overview of sprint goals;
- Demos of completed work;
- Feedback and discussion of next steps.
Avoid overly technical discussions that derail the meeting. If deeper analysis is required, schedule a follow-up session.

### Align on Next Steps
Based on review feedback, immediately update the backlog. If enhancements are requested, document them promptly and then send them to the Sprint Review attendees to ensure you’ve captured them correctly.

### Respect Time Constraints
Keep people interested, keep meetings focused, and hold meetings quickly. If the session runs long, your scrum team may be too large. Consider [splitting it](https://namegenerators.online/scrum-team-name-generator/) into smaller, more agile teams.

Sprint Reviews should last no more than an hour to ninety minutes. Sprints Reviews are large meetings involving many people; therefore, [they are expensive](https://calculatorlord.com/meeting-cost-calculator/). Keep them short, or risk management complaining about them.

### Conclusion
An effective Sprint Review provides visibility into completed work, ensures [alignment among stakeholders](https://thenewstack.io/how-platform-teams-can-align-stakeholders/), and collects valuable input that allows for quick change (the primary purpose of Agile).

To maximize the value of your Sprint Review, focus on clear communication, structured presentations, and active engagement from stakeholders. Encourage open discussions, document feedback promptly, and translate insights into actionable backlog items. By consistently refining your Sprint Review process, you’ll foster stronger collaboration, maintain stakeholder confidence, and keep your team aligned toward delivering meaningful outcomes.

A well-run Sprint Review isn’t just a meeting — it’s your team’s opportunity to showcase progress, spark innovation, and steer the project toward success.
