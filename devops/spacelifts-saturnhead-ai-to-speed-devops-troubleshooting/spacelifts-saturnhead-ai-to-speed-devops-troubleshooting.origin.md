More than “[40% of companies deploy infrastructure more than four times before getting it right](https://learn.spacelift.io/the-infrastructure-automation-report-2025),” argued [Spacelift](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wKhHoyU1fFE75F2WB-3wIx2dzR8LI0gvjzVRc6KR6FI/edit), an [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://thenewstack.io/infrastructure-as-code-the-ultimate-guide/) business, from its research.

I hate to say it, but that sounds about right to me.

To fix this, Spacelift has introduced a new service, [Saturnhead AI](https://spacelift.io/blog/introducing-saturnhead-ai). In an email, [Pawel Hytry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hytry/), [Spacelift](https://thenewstack.io/spacelift-scales-legacy-automation-terraform-first-ansible-next/) CEO, said, “We built Saturnhead AI for the practitioners—those overworked engineers stuck deciphering logs when they should be building. Pretty dashboards and fancy charts can help communicate point-in-time performance to executive-level audiences. Still, a truly effective solution must first and foremost serve the real-time needs of those on the front lines, and that’s what Saturnhead AI is designed to deliver. It’s about resolving failed deployments quickly and freeing [DevOps](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-devops/) teams to move at the speed their organizations—and their customers—demand.”

It does this by reviewing your [IaC](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-infrastructure-as-code/) runner phase logs, analyzing them, and then providing clear and actionable feedback on what happened in a particular runner phase or what has happened inside your entire run if there is a failure. By automating the manual, time-consuming process of troubleshooting and guiding DevOps teams through resolution, Saturnhead AI reduces resolution time and eliminates operational bottlenecks.

## Actionable Insights
This analysis is conducted using a generative AI (GenAI) engine, which can analyze infrastructure run logs in real time. This gives you clear, actionable explanations of failures, turning hours of log sifting by hand into seconds of instant insight. Which AI? That’s up to you. You can feed your data into your choice of large language model (LLM). At the moment, you can pick between [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/?utm_content=inline+mention)‘ [Bedrock (Anthropic)](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/) or [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/).

When you run it, you’ll be given two options:

**Summarize:**This provides an overview of what happened in every step of a run. This will provide a simple report even if the run fails.**Explanation:**This provides a troubleshooting report for failed runs. All phases of a run are analyzed — Initialization, Planning and Applying — to provide:- Identified issues: Lets you know what has happened.
- Likely causes: Tells you why this happened.
- Action steps: Offers step-by-step actions you should take to solve the issues.
By using Saturnhead AI, the company claims that, even for a modest 5 percent run failure rate, Saturnhead AI will eliminate the need to troubleshoot 1,000+ failed runs per week. I’m not sure if there would be that many failed runs, but honestly, anything that can cut down DecOps or IaC troubleshooting runs is a win in my book.

If you want to take Saturnhead AI for a spin, you can [create a free account with Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/free-trial) today or [book a demo](https://spacelift.io/schedule-demo) with one of its IaC specialists.
