Over the past couple of years, there has been extensive discussion of how generative AI can benefit DevOps practitioners. The ecosystem has been abuzz with discussions of leveraging GenAI to [accelerate virtually all aspects of day-to-day DevOps work](https://thenewstack.io/using-ai-for-devops-what-developers-and-ops-need-to-know/), from coding to software testing to documentation generation.

A topic that has received much less attention is how DevOps team managers — instead of practitioners — can use generative AI. This is a challenge because to leverage GenAI at scale, businesses must do more than hope that individual DevOps engineers will figure out how to use AI effectively. Instead, they need DevOps leadership to oversee a systematic approach to implementing and optimizing AI adoption by their DevOps teams.

As someone who has helped DevOps teams pivot to a GenAI-centric strategy, I’m here to offer thoughts on how [DevOps leads can help guide the process](https://thenewstack.io/next-gen-devops-integrate-ai-for-enhanced-workflow-automation/). Of course, every team’s challenges and opportunities related to GenAI are different, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to ensuring that DevOps teams can fully take advantage of GenAI technology. However, there are several best practices for DevOps managers to consider following.

## Why and How Can DevOps Teams Use Generative AI?
Before delving into specific ways, DevOps team managers can help steer engineers toward effective adoption of GenAI, let’s discuss what GenAI can do for today’s DevOps practitioners.

The short answer is that[ generative AI](https://thenewstack.io/genai-helps-frontend-developers-create-components/) has emerged as a significant productivity booster — you might even call it a pair programmer — for DevOps engineers. To date, no AI tool is reliable and flexible enough to supplant DevOps workers entirely, but AI can add substantial efficiency to their work.

For example, [by using AI to generate boilerplate code](https://thenewstack.io/5-best-practices-for-building-reliable-genai-apps/), DevOps engineers avoid having to copy and paste from code templates and tweak the results to fit a given use case. Likewise, they can ask AI to explain how code works, accelerating the process of interpreting code from third-party sources. They can even benefit from GenAI for tasks like generating test cases, which they can then use to test their code — whether AI-generated or written the old-fashioned way — and ensure it works as expected.

Of course, competent DevOps engineers can complete tasks like this without AI. However, AI makes them faster and reduces their cognitive load.

## Best Practices for Managing GenAI Adoption by DevOps Teams
In most cases, leveraging GenAI for DevOps use cases like these doesn’t happen automatically or organically. Engineers need deliberate guidance from DevOps leadership on approaching AI and integrating it efficiently and securely into their workflows.

The following practices can help DevOps team managers deliver that guidance.

### 1. Roll Out AI Capabilities
It may seem obvious that a DevOps team can’t adopt AI very well if AI tools are unavailable. But too often, I’ve encountered environments where businesses place strict limitations on which AI technologies employees can use, typically in a bid to mitigate security and data privacy risks associated with AI (like the potential for proprietary code to leak to third parties when engineers don’t use AI tools securely).

These risks are real but are not a reason to avoid using Al. Companies that take that approach shoot themselves in the feet and will miss out on the massive DevOps productivity gains that come with AI. As a result, organizations will lose a competitive advantage over firms that operate with higher productivity due to AI.

Instead, DevOps managers should collaborate with other business stakeholders to roll out appropriate GenAI technology for DevOps practitioners, such as AI-assisted coding and testing tools. With a proper technology adoption process, the business can identify AI solutions that meet its needs while minimizing security risks.

### 2. Allocate Sufficient Budget
Along similar lines, AI tools for DevOps often cost money. Management must be willing to allocate sufficient financial resources to support the adoption of the GenAI tool.

Suppose a push to invest in GenAI solutions leads to blowback from other business stakeholders. In that case, DevOps managers should stress the productivity boost likely to stem from AI and encourage other leaders to view AI as a means of saving money in the long run.

### 3. Adopt GenAI Tools for Management Tasks
In addition to overseeing the adoption of GenAI by DevOps engineers, team managers can use it to draft emails, create presentations, and summarize content.

The more hands-on experience managers gain with real-world use of GenAI, the better positioned they’ll be to help guide staff in applying AI to their roles.

### 4. Provide Oversight (Especially for Junior Engineers)
DevOps engineers — exceptionally experienced junior engineers — need oversight to do their jobs effectively. This becomes all the more true when they begin using AI.

Typically, practitioners don’t know how to guide GenAI tools to achieve desired results appropriately. For example, they may not know how best to verbalize the instructions they feed to AI to generate or explain code. They may also struggle to recognize errors in AI-produced code.

A primary responsibility of DevOps managers overseeing a pivot to GenAI is supervising how practitioners use AI tools and identifying challenges like these. It is unrealistic to expect engineers — especially junior engineers with limited experience — to pick up a complex new tool like AI and learn to use it optimally.

### 5. Measure Success in Terms of Ends, Not Means
A good DevOps manager doesn’t fixate on exactly how engineers use AI — or, for that matter, any type of productivity-enhancement technology. Instead, they focus on what the results are.

To that end, managers should assess the success of their practitioners by determining how efficiently they can complete tasks like writing, testing, and deploying code, not how extensively they rely on AI to do these things. Some engineers are likely to find more excellent value in AI than others. The manager’s role is to encourage practitioners for productivity’s sake, not to achieve some arbitrary level of AI adoption.

### 6. Be Patient in Assessing AI’s Benefits for DevOps
Finally, DevOps managers should understand that integrating AI into DevOps is a significant paradigm shift and takes time to bear all of its fruit. Expecting substantial productivity gains in just a few months is unrealistic for developers with an average skill level (although some may learn faster); a more reasonable timeline is half a year, at a minimum, before engineers become sufficiently adept at GenAI usage to demonstrate substantial improvements.

The upside is that once AI becomes an integral part of DevOps workflows, its benefits will likely continue to accrue as practitioners learn to take ever-greater advantage of GenAI solutions. However, the initial learning curve is steep, and setting realistic expectations is essential.
