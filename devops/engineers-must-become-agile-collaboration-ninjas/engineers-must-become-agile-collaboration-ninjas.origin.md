# Engineers Must Become Agile Collaboration Ninjas
I get caught in nostalgia sometimes, remembering how things were before smartphones demanded unrelenting attention. MTV still showed music videos, computers were[ just a distant idea](https://thenewstack.io/50-years-later-remembering-how-the-future-looked-in-1974/), and AI hadn’t changed everything. I was recently thinking about how product engineering is entirely unrecognizable from what it was 10, five, or even one year ago. When I stop and consider how quickly things change, it’s easy to understand how people can get left behind. Cloud computing, DevOps, AI, machine learning, and IoT have joined the party and are here to stay.

To avoid getting lost in these changes, we have to master our relationship with them and make sure everyone, from veterans to newcomers, is best prepared to face this new beast and harness new skills to be better, more agile engineers.

Every stage of evolution in the product engineering realm has required a new set of skills, and this is no different; rewriting the job description has been the only constant. From agile methodology to [cloud computing and DevOps](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native-basics-4-concepts-to-know/), developers have made quick learning a priceless talent. However, the required skills take a turn off the beaten path this time.

Throughout the typical changes, innovations have required various technical skills and the ability to embrace new working methods and cultivate a mindset that transcends technical expertise. Now, collaboration is the name of the game, especially in small, self-managed teams that work together. Customer focus, accountability for product success, agile and DevOps integration, automation proficiency, and security and UX awareness, among others, have brought many more factors into play. Since [product engineering now involves many teams](https://thenewstack.io/why-successful-platform-engineering-teams-need-a-product-manager/) from all business areas, technical and not, playing nicely has become a top priority.

## Masters of New Skills
We all know the age-old jokes about IT staff and engineers being awkward and antisocial. The teams hunched over keyboards in the dark corner of the office. When asked for help, they would offer explanations that only one of their kind could understand — not exactly the pinnacle of communication skills. This engineer boogie monster was surely needed but not necessarily enjoyed.

No one probably thought that this group would soon be at the forefront of collaboration, but here we are. Dirt paths between departments have become highways, and the dividing walls are crumbling.

Skills that were often overlooked are now in the spotlight. Engineers must now become masters of both the technical and the expressive worlds, on top of the [new skills demanded by AI](https://thenewstack.io/ai-demands-more-than-just-technical-skills-from-developers/). Teamwork is everything, and excellent technical skills alone aren’t enough anymore.

## Sharing Our Voice
Many of us might find ourselves clarifying concepts we never thought we’d have to explain, vocalizing new needs, and relying on others in new ways. Complex technical concepts need to be articulated in ways accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

Excellent cross-departmental communications skills and top-tier team working skills are an absolute necessity. [In a study in France](https://www.sefi.be/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/56476.-Kovesi.pdf), engineering students who participated in interdisciplinary thinking programs showed a higher capacity for exploring, analyzing, and understanding complex phenomena. These skills were considered “essential to prepare for their professional career.” Take time to nurture this skill, and your career will benefit.

Adaptability and learning [agility have become priceless in a world](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-the-role-of-software-architect-in-an-agile-world/) of rapid change. We must consider and empathize with many new perspectives, such as data-driven decision-making, user experience, and security. Forgetting or undermining the importance of intentionally [developing these skills](https://thenewstack.io/beyond-hello-world-startup-gamifies-development-skills/) can be serious; your work and abilities now affect more teams and areas than ever. Make sure you’re making your impact a positive one.

## Cultivating Success in Collaboration
Many of us may feel lost by the idea of “just getting better at collaboration.” So what can we do to succeed in this new world? It’s easier than you might think.

- Respect deadlines and schedules. Sometimes, we can picture collaboration as more complex and social. But in reality, it can be relatively straightforward: keep to your deadlines and promises; this will cultivate respect and nurture relationships.
- Align on goals.
[A study with Intuit Canada](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00218863221106245)found that engineers collaborating in broad, unclear environments felt frustrated and uncomfortable, but once the missions became aligned, implementation was quickly achieved. If there is a lack of clarity or goals aren’t synched up, we must take the reins and get our collaborative teams on the right track. - Avoid talking down. Engineers, who often have very specialized knowledge, can easily be viewed as arrogant by other teams. Working with others usually includes explaining industry topics to someone far outside this zone. Speak clearly and empathize, and pay attention to how others describe their work.
## Keeping Focus on Key Changes
Alongside a new need for collaboration, a few other key areas have been affected by the latest changes that should be noticed. With more projects moving across teams, security has become even more important. Increased shared information can also increase cybersecurity risks; popular collaboration tools have become [targets for data attacks](https://abnormalsecurity.com/blog/security-risks-collaboration-tools). Education around data breaches and cybersecurity threats and how to prevent them needs to be integrated at every phase of the product lifecycle; proper training and education have been found to [decrease cybersecurity incidents](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10796-019-09977-z).

Additionally, everything has become more user-centric. Therefore, we also need to [keep User Experience](https://thenewstack.io/prototype-the-path-to-keep-user-experiences-front-and-center/) (UX) and the principles of good design in mind during development. UX/UI designers should collaborate closely to help us make informed decisions that improve usability and accessibility. [UX professionals](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/product-and-ux-design-effective-ways-to-work-together/) discussed how to best collaborate with product engineers and emphasized the importance of clear product roadmaps, user empathy maps, and robust feedback loops.

Remember to keep everything in context with intentional product thinking. Understanding the market, competitive landscape, and evolving needs makes an engineer highly valuable. Active and open participation in strategy and vision discussions helps keep the end goal in focus.

## A Couple Words for the Veterans…
Some of us have stayed the course through many waves of change and may see this as just another step forward. But I believe these innovations are different than any we’ve encountered before, and we need to be especially vigilant, particularly in these two areas:

First, leave no man behind. Everyone responds to change differently, but reactions can usually be divided into three categories: enthusiastic adopters who jump right in, excited but unsure adopters who need guidance, and those who just feel lost. Pay attention to how every team member reacts and where they are in the process. For many people, enthusiasm doesn’t come immediately; be patient and mindful. With contentious feelings surrounding AI, this is more important than ever.

Second, take a breath before diving in. New, exciting programs and strategies are exploding daily, and implementing innovations can sometimes be addicting. I remember being amazed at teams from big companies who push out changes every 5 minutes. How exciting would that be if my team could do that? A competitor implemented a new AI program that looked shiny. But it wouldn’t align with my needs. Every business and its needs are unique. Comparison can be dangerous. Take a breath and look at *your *[needs before diving into new systems](https://thenewstack.io/devs-need-system-design-tools-not-diagramming-tools/).

## … And Some for the Newcomers
Many people ask me for advice on what tools to learn, what classes to take, and what internships to prioritize to [land a great job](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-land-a-new-dev-or-it-job-advice-from-hr-professionals/). I have two major pieces of advice for those diving into the industry.

Find your niche. What are *you *passionate about? It’s easy to follow the hype (GenAI, anyone?), but you’ll burn out if it’s not something you love. Did your [Python](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-python/) classes especially interest you? What about simple scripting, new-age coding, or product thinking? Seek out what inspires you. There are many great online resources and training programs to dive deeper into.

Lastly, venture outside the technical aspects. I’ve said many times already, but collaboration is everything. Step outside your comfort zone, enroll in a public speaking course, join (or initiate) team projects, and get an internship or volunteer experience outside your major. Top-tier communicators are incredibly sought after, and mastering these non-technical skills gives you the upper hand in a brutal job market. Technology is evolving daily, and old ways of doing things are left behind, but communication skills will always be valuable.

## AI Isn’t the Only Thing on the Horizon
As much as I’m impressed by how far things have come, I’m also excited about the unlimited innovations. I’m looking forward to IoT, AR/VR integrations, and blockchain involvement, and I’m sure they’ll be here before we know it. On our horizon are new teams to collaborate with, new skills to learn, and new fears to overcome. Product engineering — or whatever we might call it in the future — is an industry that is born to change, and I’m excited to be on for the ride.
