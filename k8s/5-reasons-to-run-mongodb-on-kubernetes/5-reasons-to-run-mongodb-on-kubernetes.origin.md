Running MongoDB on Kubernetes is a smart choice for businesses looking to meet scalability, reliability and performance demands. The integration of these two technologies addresses some of the most critical challenges businesses face in managing large-scale, dynamic environments. From simplifying operations to ensuring high availability, the reasons to leverage Kubernetes for your MongoDB deployment are compelling.
Let’s explore the top five reasons why running MongoDB on Kubernetes is a recommended strategy for businesses seeking to optimize their data infrastructure for the future. Whether you’re a developer, a database administrator or a business decision-maker, understanding these advantages can help you navigate the complexities of modern application deployment and make informed choices.
**Avoid Vendor Lock-in**
Kubernetes provides the flexibility to deploy databases across multiple cloud providers or hybrid environments. This is particularly beneficial for organizations wanting to avoid vendor lock-in or those that require distributed deployments across various geographical locations to reduce latency and comply with data sovereignty laws.
Such flexibility is achieved through
[Kubernetes uniform APIs](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-is-not-just-about-containers-its-about-the-api/) — the same primitives, commands and tools across different environments. MongoDB clusters can run anywhere — cloud and/or on-premises — and engineering teams don’t need to change the toolset in case of migrations.
**Eliminate Toil** [Kubernetes is designed to automate](https://thenewstack.io/kudo-automates-kubernetes-operators/) routine tasks when it comes to container orchestration. But the real power comes with [Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) — software extensions in Kubernetes that manage applications.
Kubernetes Operators, like
[Percona Operator for MongoDB](https://www.percona.com/mongodb/software/percona-operator-for-mongodb), not only automate the deployment but also remove the complexity of Day 2 operations. Now engineers can leverage the expertise embedded in the Operator code and spend more time on building applications.
**Lower Costs**
Seventy percent of respondents in a Cloud Native Computing Foundation
[ FinOps survey](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/CNCF_Finops-Microsurvey-2023.pdf) named overprovisioning as the main cause of overspending.
Containerization by design allows you to reduce overutilization by densely packing workloads on a single machine. Additionally, with Kubernetes efficiently managing resources across a cluster, your MongoDB footprint runs effectively and with no performance or availability issues, but on a significantly smaller resource footprint.
Open source technologies, like various Operators for MongoDB, also allow you to avoid high licensing costs and slash your bill further.
**Ecosystem and Integrations**
Kubernetes has a vast ecosystem and integrates well with a variety of tools and platforms, which can enhance the capabilities of MongoDB. This includes everything from monitoring and logging tools to continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Running MongoDB on Kubernetes allows you to take advantage of this ecosystem, making it easier to build, deploy and maintain robust applications.
**Faster Development**
Running MongoDB on Kubernetes as a developer offers several key benefits that streamline your workflow and enhance the overall development experience. First, it simplifies the deployment process, allowing you to easily
[scale your MongoDB clusters](https://thenewstack.io/the-smallest-kubernetes-cluster-scaling-down-to-the-edge/) up or down based on the application’s needs, directly from your development environment. As we mentioned earlier, the operators’ automated management features reduce the time and effort you spend on database administration, letting you focus more on coding and less on operational tasks.
Additionally, the integration with
[Kubernetes facilitates a more seamless DevOps and CI/CD pipeline](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-ci-cd-pipelines-explained/), enabling you to automate the deployment of your MongoDB databases alongside your application code. This integration helps in achieving faster development cycles, consistent testing environments and more reliable releases.
Moreover, Kubernetes’ support for containerized environments ensures that your MongoDB instances run in isolated, reproducible environments. This consistency across development, testing and production minimizes “it works on my machine” problems, leading to fewer deployment issues and more time spent on developing new features or improving existing ones.
**What Next? **
Together MongoDB and Kubernetes represent a modern application deployment that addresses key challenges in scalability, operational efficiency and flexibility. By leveraging Kubernetes for MongoDB deployments, businesses can not only optimize their data infrastructure but also foster innovation and agility across their development teams.
The first commit for
[Percona Operator for MongoDB](https://github.com/percona/percona-server-mongodb-operator) was created six years ago. Throughout these years we saw databases on Kubernetes evolving from greenfield technology to enterprise-grade, go-to solutions. Try it out; it is 100% open source. [
