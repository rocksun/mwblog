The Global Kubernetes market size stands at 2.11 billion USD in 2024 and is [expected to reach 11.8 billion by 2032](https://www.skyquestt.com/report/kubernetes-market/market-size#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20global%20market,period%20(2025%2D2032).), a CAGR increase of 24%.

While the Kubernetes market is booming, so is Hybrid as a working mode for tech jobs, as employees find the [option to work Hybrid equivalent to an 8% wage increase](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/04/09/how-to-make-hybrid-work-a-success), and [46% would rather quit if they are asked to report to the Office every day](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/02/whats-in-store-for-remote-work-and-rto-in-2025.html).

Interestingly, **30% of Kubernetes jobs now embrace the hybrid work model!** This intriguing trend raises some compelling questions: How competitive are the salaries for these hybrid positions? Which job titles offer the most hybrid work? What is the [future preference for working modes](https://thenewstack.io/the-future-of-flexible-work-in-the-tech-industry/) in the tech industry?

We will answer the above questions (and perhaps more) by analysing the Kubernetes job market data. We’ll use [Kube Careers’](https://kube.careers/) [State of the Kubernetes jobs market report 2024](https://gist.github.com/vik-codes/282dda73d66ca8ed6d049a7d4350cbf1) for our analysis, wherein they have collected more than 25,000 jobs, meticulously filtering these down to a dataset of 4850 jobs.

What are their criteria for the filtration? All jobs listed must [require Kubernetes experience](https://thenewstack.io/a-better-developer-experience-requires-better-testing-tools/), mention explicit salary ranges, and not be listed by recruitment agencies.

Let’s dig through some numbers, shall we?

**1 in 3 Kubernetes Jobs Is Hybrid**
Of the 4850 jobs published in 2024, ** 1803 (37%)** were strictly

**requiring Office presence 5 days a week,**
*In-Office jobs***1679 (34.61%)**were
**Hybrid jobs**— most of these mention a minimum frequency of weekly In-Office visits, and
**were**
*1368 (28.20%)***— most of these were restricted within a geography.**
*Remote jobs***Hybrid Jobs Have Increased Year-on-Year, but It May Not Be the Case in 2025**
A quarterly view of the preferences for working modes gives us a clearer picture of the trend.

Here are the key takeaways from the year-on-year comparison:

**Remote work has declined in the past year.**- In Q1 2023, 45% of the total jobs were Remote, which has since declined to 34% in Q4 2024. Remember that these remote jobs are mostly restricted within the country — for 2024, a staggering 97.9% of the total
[remote jobs require the employee to work](https://thenewstack.io/the-newest-remote-working-alternative-working-from-hotels/)within the country. - Remote jobs have declined by 7% since the last two quarters of 2024, and it seems unlikely they will rebound in 2025.
- In Q1 2023, 45% of the total jobs were Remote, which has since declined to 34% in Q4 2024. Remember that these remote jobs are mostly restricted within the country — for 2024, a staggering 97.9% of the total
**Hybrid is to the rescue, but not for long.**- In 2023, on average, 21% of the Kubernetes jobs were Hybrid, while in 2024, the metric has increased to 29%.
- However, from Q3 to Q4 of 2024, there has been a slight decline of 5% in hybrid jobs. Looking at the current stand of

**In-office jobs may see a revival in 2025.**- In-office jobs were consistent from Q1 2023 until about Q2 2024, averaging 29% between the quarters.
- However, in the last two quarters of 2024, these jobs have seen a resurgent increase of 11%. This re-emergence may continue into 2025 since, lately

**Hybrid Jobs Pay a Minimum Salary of $132,288 Per Annum**![](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/03/6b395415-409908879-ddd5c254-4534-453c-9247-ac9b1af8ce75.svg)
For 2024, ** Hybrid jobs paid a minimum average salary of $132,288** and a

**, taking the mean average salary to**
*maximum average of $188,568***$160,428.**
*Things get interesting if we compare the average salaries across working modes!*
The key insights here are:

- For average minimum salaries, Hybrid jobs pay
, which is*$132,288*than*7% higher*jobs, and*Remote***4% higher**than**In-Office jobs.** - For maximum average salaries, In-Office jobs offer
, which is*$191,475*and*5%*higher than*1.4%***Remote**and**Hybrid**jobs. This difference makes sense since most high-paying jobs will be at the senior level and, hence, more in-office. - Regarding the average salary, the order is
with*Hybrid > In-Office > Remote**$160,428 > $158,735.5 > $151,029.*
In all, it can be said that [Hybrid jobs paid the highest](https://thenewstack.io/chef-extends-security-and-compliance-across-hybrid-cloud/) average salaries across working modes in 2024.

**Surprisingly, the Most Hybrid-Friendly Positions Were Machine Learning Engineer, Head of Platform Engineering, and Data Engineer**
Here are the stats for the most hybrid-friendly job titles:

of all*41.6%*positions offer[Machine Learning Engineer](https://thenewstack.io/5-new-kubeflow-1-3-features-that-machine-learning-engineers-will-love/),*hybrid work*offer*38%*, and*remote work*are*19.9%**In-Office.*- What’s surprising to see is
**Head of Platform Engineering**is the**second most hybrid-friendly**role with**35.1%**of these offering hybrid working. - The order then is
*Data Engineer > Engineering Manager > Head of Engineering > Software Architect*with*33.7% > 33.5% > 33.3% > 32.35%.*
**Summary**
- Throughout all the quarters of 2024, Hybrid jobs have averaged at least 27-30% while also
[paying the highest average salaries among the working](https://thenewstack.io/training-hard-work-pays-off-for-data-ai-pros/)modes. - However, the Forecast suggests Remote and Hybrid jobs may decline by 5-10% in 2025 while In-Office jobs may increase by the same margin.
