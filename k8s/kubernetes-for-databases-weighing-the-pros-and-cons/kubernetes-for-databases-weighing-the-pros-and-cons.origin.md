Over the past few decades, [database](https://thenewstack.io/databases/) management has shifted from traditional relational databases on monolithic hardware to cloud native, distributed environments. With the rise of microservices and containerization, modern databases need to fit seamlessly into more complex, dynamic systems, requiring advanced solutions to balance scale, performance and flexibility.

For large organizations navigating these complex environments, managing databases at scale presents myriad challenges. Companies with extensive [data](https://thenewstack.io/data/) operations often face issues like ensuring high availability, disaster recovery and scaling resources efficiently. To tackle these, many adopt a hybrid approach, combining on-premises infrastructure with cloud resources to meet their diverse needs.

A natural result of this hybrid model is the push toward standardization. By consolidating various components, including databases, onto a unified infrastructure platform, organizations aim to reduce operational overhead and improve consistency across different environments, streamlining their overall operations.

## Why Kubernetes Is Gaining Traction for Databases
As [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/) has become the default infrastructure layer for many enterprises, running databases on Kubernetes is becoming more prevalent. Initially, there was skepticism about Kubernetesâ€™ suitability for database workloads. However, this has changed as [Kubernetes has matured](https://roadmap.sh/kubernetes) and the community has developed tools and best practices for managing [stateful applications](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-better-manage-stateful-applications-in-kubernetes/).

For platform engineers, Kubernetes offers a robust framework to build internal database management platforms. This approach allows for custom solutions tailored to specific organizational needs, such as automated provisioning and integration with existing CI/CD pipelines.

### Benefits of Running Databases on Kubernetes
**Standardization**: Kubernetes provides a unified platform for managing databases and applications across on-premises and cloud environments.**Self-service**: Developers and teams can provision and manage databases through self-service, streamlining operations.**Scalability**: Kubernetes supports elastic scaling, allowing databases to handle varying workloads seamlessly.**Resilience**: Built-in features like failover and recovery increase the reliability of databases running on Kubernetes.
## Overcoming the Challenges of Kubernetes for Databases
Despite the benefits, managing databases on Kubernetes introduces complexities. These include maintaining stateful applications, ensuring data consistency and integrating with existing infrastructure.

Fortunately, the Kubernetes ecosystem has responded with tools like operators, which simplify the management of stateful applications by automating common tasks such as backups, scaling and updates.

Key approaches to database management on Kubernetes include:

**Hyperscalers or public database as a service (DBaaS) providers**: These services are easy to use but often come with[higher costs](https://thenewstack.io/the-hidden-cost-of-dbaass-convenience/), hidden fees, limited customization and potential vendor lock-in.**Proprietary or private DBaaS solutions**: While less expensive than hyperscalers and requiring fewer internal resources, these solutions can still result in lock-in and may grow more costly as data scales.**Building an internal platform**: This option offers maximum control and eliminates vendor lock-in but requires significant internal expertise and maintenance, as well as careful management of included components like:**Operators**: Kubernetes operators play a crucial role in managing database instances by automating common tasks such as backups, scaling and updates.**Monitoring and troubleshooting**: Effective monitoring and troubleshooting tools are essential for managing the health and performance of databases running on Kubernetes.
## The Future of Database Management
The shift towards Kubernetes and the evolution of open source tools have redefined how enterprises manage databases. Open source [Percona Everest](https://www.percona.com/software/percona-everest) addresses many of these challenges by automating database provisioning and management across any Kubernetes infrastructure, whether deployed in the cloud or on premises.

For enterprises seeking a flexible, scalable and cost-effective database solution, Percona Everest presents a compelling alternative to traditional database management strategies.
