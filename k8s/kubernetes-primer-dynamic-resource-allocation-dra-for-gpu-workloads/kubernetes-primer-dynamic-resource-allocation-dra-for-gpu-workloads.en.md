In the previous [article](https://thenewstack.io/gpu-orchestration-in-kubernetes-device-plugin-or-gpu-operator/), I introduced Device Plugin and GPU Operator to expose the underlying accelerated infrastructure to Kubernetes workloads. In this article, I will introduce an emerging feature of [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/) called [Dynamic Resource Allocation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/) (DRA) that makes GPU orchestration efficient.

Traditional Kubernetes resource management was designed around simple countable resources like CPU and memory. This model worked well for general computing but struggled with specialized hardware such as GPUs and purpose-built AI accelerators.

The device plugin framework introduced in Kubernetes 1.8 attempted to address this gap but suffered from fundamental architectural limitations. Device plugins could only report the number of available devices without any information about their specific attributes or capabilities. Each device was allocated entirely to a single container with no possibility for sharing or fractional allocation.

## Limitations of Device Plugin Architecture

The Device Plugin framework in Kubernetes suffers from several architectural limitations that hinder efficient hardware utilization and management. Its integer-based resource model treats devices as fungible counts, which cannot capture differences in GPU models, memory sizes or performance attributes.

This forces operators to rely on [node labels and nodeSelectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes/), creating brittle infrastructure coupling and operational complexity. The framework also prohibits device sharing, meaning a single container can monopolize a high-end GPU even if it uses only a fraction of its capacity, leading to widespread underutilization.

It further lacks parameterization, preventing workloads from dynamically configuring devices with settings like [Multi-Instance GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/technologies/multi-instance-gpu/) (MIG) profiles or power limits, making advanced configurations vendor-specific and nonportable.

The scheduler operates blindly, with no awareness of device topology or cluster-wide resources, resulting in inefficient placement decisions that degrade performance for distributed workloads. Health monitoring is rudimentary, often leaving Pods stuck on failed devices unless external controllers intervene. Finally, device plugins typically run as privileged [DaemonSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) with extensive host access, creating serious security risks.

Together, these deficiencies expose a fundamental misalignment between the framework’s simplistic design and the complex, heterogeneous nature of modern accelerators, storage devices and network interfaces, making it insufficient for next-generation Kubernetes workloads.

## Understanding the DRA Architecture

The DRA architecture represents a complete redesign of how Kubernetes manages specialized resources. At its core, DRA introduces several new API objects in the `resource.k8s.io` API group that work together to enable dynamic allocation.

**ResourceClaim** objects describe requests for specific resources with detailed requirements expressed through [Common Expression Language](https://cel.dev/) (CEL) filters. A claim might request a GPU with at least 16GB of memory and specific compute capabilities. These claims can be created manually for shared resources or generated automatically per pod through **ResourceClaimTemplates**. The life cycle of a ResourceClaim tracks the entire allocation process from initial request through binding to eventual cleanup.

**DeviceClass** objects define categories of devices with selection criteria that platform administrators create when installing DRA drivers. These classes use CEL expressions to filter devices based on their attributes. A DeviceClass for high-performance computing or running AI workloads might select only GPUs with specific memory configurations and compute architectures. The structured parameters within DeviceClass objects enable the scheduler to understand device requirements without opaque, vendor-specific configurations.

**ResourceSlice** objects are published by DRA drivers to advertise available resources on each node. These slices contain detailed device attributes, including memory capacity, architecture versions and vendor-specific capabilities. The scheduler uses this information to match pod requirements with available resources. Unlike the static reporting of device plugins, ResourceSlices provide dynamic updates as device availability changes.

## A Paradigm Shift Inspired by Storage

To address the deep-seated limitations of the Device Plugin framework, Kubernetes introduced Dynamic Resource Allocation. DRA represents a fundamental paradigm shift in how specialized hardware is managed, drawing inspiration from the mature and well-understood model for dynamic storage provisioning using [PersistentVolumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) (PVs) and [PersistentVolumeClaims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) (PVCs).

This analogy provides a powerful mental model for engineers. A DeviceClass in DRA is analogous to a StorageClass, defining a type of available resource. A ResourceClaim is analogous to a PVC, representing a user’s request for an instance of that resource. This approach decouples the request for a resource from its underlying implementation, providing immense flexibility.

The following table compares the key components of DRA with their storage counterparts and identifies the primary user personas associated with each.

| Concept | Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) | Impacted DRA Persona | Storage Primitives | Impacted Storage Persona |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Defines a “type” or “class” of available resource | DeviceClass | Cluster Admin, Device Owner | StorageClass | Cluster Admin, Storage Specialist |
| A user’s request for a resource instance | ResourceClaim, ResourceClaimTemplate | Workload Operator | PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) | Developer, Workload Operator |
| Represents an actual, available resource in the cluster | ResourceSlice | DRA Driver (Device Owner) | PersistentVolume (PV) | Cluster Admin, Storage Specialist |

## How DRA Transforms Resource Allocation Workflows

The technical workflow of DRA demonstrates its advantages over traditional approaches. When a user creates a pod with ResourceClaim requirements, the scheduler immediately begins analyzing these claims through the DynamicResources plugin. The scheduler queries ResourceSlices across the cluster to identify devices matching the CEL selection criteria. Complex expressions can evaluate multiple attributes simultaneously, such as requiring both minimum memory and specific architectural features.

Once suitable devices are identified, the scheduler selects the optimal node and device combination based on overall cluster optimization goals. The allocation details are written directly to the ResourceClaim status, eliminating the need for external driver involvement in scheduling decisions. This approach enables the scheduler to handle resource allocation for multiple pods in parallel, significantly improving throughput compared to device plugins.

After the pod is bound to a node, the kubelet’s DRA manager takes over local resource management. It calls the NodePrepareResources gRPC method on the appropriate DRA driver plugin. The driver prepares the hardware device and generates Container Device Interface specifications that configure container access to the resources. When the pod terminates, the kubelet calls NodeUnprepareResources to clean up and release the resources for future allocations.

DRA drivers follow a two-component architecture that separates control plane and node-level operations. The controller component runs centrally and manages ResourceSlice creation and updates. It watches for ResourceClaim changes and handles resource life cycle management. The kubelet plugin component runs on each node as a DaemonSet and implements the gRPC interface for device preparation and cleanup. This separation enables better scalability and cleaner architectural boundaries than the monolithic device plugin approach.

## Current Limitations and Future Trajectory

DRA is currently in beta status with several feature gates controlling different capabilities. The core DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate has been available since [Kubernetes 1.32](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-1-32-aces-api-conformance-testing/). Additional alpha features include partitionable devices for dynamic reconfiguration, device taints and tolerations for administrative control, and prioritized lists for fallback device selection. These features are undergoing active development and testing in preparation for the general availability release.

Several technical challenges remain for full DRA maturity. Network-attached resources that are not visible before attachment require additional development. The complexity of implementing DRA drivers is higher than that of traditional device plugins, creating a learning curve for vendors. ResourceSlice objects may face scaling challenges with extensive device inventories. The community is actively addressing these limitations through enhanced testing and performance optimizations.

The just-released [Kubernetes 1.34](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/07/28/kubernetes-v1-34-sneak-peek/) includes several important enhancements. The DRA Extended Resource Bridge will enable seamless migration from existing device plugins. Device binding conditions will provide priority-based readiness checks. Consumable capacity features will enable more sophisticated sharing models. Native health monitoring will integrate device status directly into the Kubernetes resource model.

## Transitioning to DRA

Organizations should begin evaluating DRA for their specialized workload requirements. Platform teams running AI and machine learning (ML) workloads will see immediate benefits from GPU sharing and dynamic allocation capabilities. High-performance computing environments can leverage DRA for complex topology requirements and cross-device dependencies. Network function virtualization deployments can use DRA for sophisticated network resource management.

The migration from device plugins to DRA requires careful planning but offers significant long-term benefits. Organizations should establish test environments with DRA beta features to gain operational experience. Development teams need training on the structured parameters model and CEL-based device selection. Vendor relationships should be evaluated to ensure DRA driver availability for critical hardware resources.

Dynamic Resource Allocation represents the future of specialized hardware management in Kubernetes. The technology addresses fundamental limitations that have constrained resource utilization and workload flexibility for years. With strong ecosystem support and a clear path to general availability, DRA is positioned to become the standard approach for managing GPUs, accelerators and other specialized resources in cloud native environments. Organizations that begin adoption planning now will be well-positioned to leverage these capabilities as they mature toward production readiness.
