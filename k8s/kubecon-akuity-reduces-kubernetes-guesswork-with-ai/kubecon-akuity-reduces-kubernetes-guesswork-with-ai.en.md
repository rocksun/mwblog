ATLANTA — Cloud Native GitOps service provider

[Akuity](https://akuity.io)

has added generative AI aids into its Kubernetes deployment platform, in order to help sysops better manage the incidents and misconfigurations.

Those attending

[KubeCon+CloudNativeCon 2025](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/?utm_source=the+new+stack&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=event)

in Atlanta this week can stop by the booth #830 for an in-person demonstration, both of the Akuity platform and its AI enhancements.

Unlike Argo CD, the Akuity commercial edition has a distributed, agent-based architecture. Credentials are saved locally and used to access the cluster API and the repo, also locally.

## The Rise of Argo CD

As enterprise use of Kubernetes has grown in the past few years, enterprises are finding that they need to streamline the deployment of Kubernetes and apps that run on Kubernetes clusters.

Akuity’s customer base has grown hardily since its launch in 2021, and includes high-profile users such as GPU cloud provider CoreWeave and Thinking Machines Lab. It has users across the major verticals, including those in the Fortune 100.

A typical user may run 50 or 100 applications on Akuity, though the company recently found a case of 20,000 applications on the platform, said Akuity co-founder and CEO

[Hong Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hwang8/)

, in an interview with TNS.

Wang was also one of the co-creators of Argo CD.

“We created Argo to solve a very practical problem from our day-to-day usage” of Kubernetes, Wang said. “We had many clusters to manage. We wanted one deployment solution to deploy multiple clusters.”

Wang was then working for a startup, which was later sold to Intuit, and Argo came along too.

At Intuit, the Argo core team developed a developer-friendly interface for developers who are unfamiliar with Kubernetes.

Research from [theCube](https://www.thecube.net/) Research Application Development and Modernization Practice has shown that 70% organizations using Kubernetes have found scalability and reliability as their top challenges, and 60% grapple with fragmented toolchains.

Akuity’s “GitOps-driven approach enables organizations to move beyond DIY scripting and brittle operations to a more reliable, secure and automated Kubernetes operating model,” said theCube lead, [Paul Nashawaty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulnashawaty/) said, in a statement.

It is available both as a hosted service, or as software to be run in the client’s data center.

## AI Comes to Deployment

The new AI capabilities will help detect degraded states across applications, triage incidents and automate fixes.

The Akuity Intelligence feature offers a number of features, including

* **Incident detection**, that can send alerts when workloads drift from a healthy state and remediates them
* **Centralize incident reporting**, with logs, events, metrics and deployment histories.
* **Runbook autonomy**, allowing incidents to be resolved automatically.
* **Real-time Slack updates** on incident status and actions taken.
* **Access control** with approval gates, scoped permissions and full audit trails.

“With Akuity’s new AI capabilities, we are able to immediately find dozens of issues, all with instant analysis and summaries, reducing guesswork for engineers. It also allows engineers to quickly resolve ongoing infrastructure issues without having to be an expert on how to deploy changes,” said Major League Baseball principal DevOps engineer [Michael Goodness](https://github.com/mgoodness), in a statement.

Akuity Intelligence is generally available and can be downloaded as a free trial.
