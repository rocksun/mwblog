We’ve seen this story before…
Over the past decade,
[cloud computing](https://thenewstack.io/Cloud-Services/) and [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/) emerged as revolutionary forces by promising scalability, efficiency and operational flexibility. These innovations changed how organizations deployed and managed digital infrastructure, with cloud services enabling easy resource scaling and Kubernetes offering [sophisticated container orchestration](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-1-30-gets-better-at-naming-things/).
Yet this swift scale of technological adoption brought challenges, notably configuration
[technology debt](https://thenewstack.io/3-sources-of-tech-debt-and-how-to-manage-it/) — a complex issue that hampers developer productivity, causes system outages and increases security risks. This issue could have been prevented if organizations implemented a proactive configuration [data management strategy](https://thenewstack.io/data-management-strategy-is-more-strategic-than-you-think/).
Emerging
[artificial intelligence](https://thenewstack.io/ai/) (AI) technologies are following a similar trajectory. The initial excitement around AI’s potential allows us to avoid repeating past mistakes, including accruing configuration tech debt.
Addressing config debt early in AI development is crucial to avoid the previous config challenges cloud and container technologies faced in their fast rise to the mainstream.
## The Rapid Ascent of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing revolutionized IT, emphasizing scalability, flexibility and cost-efficiency. Businesses quickly moved from expensive on-premises
[data centers to the cloud](https://thenewstack.io/data-center-and-cloud-environments-for-next-generation-data-stacks/), valuing agility and innovation. Yet this transition introduced configuration complexities, leading to configuration debt as companies struggled to [optimize cloud services for performance and cost](https://thenewstack.io/tricks-for-cloud-cost-optimization/).
The industry responded by developing tools and best practices for cloud management, prioritizing simplicity, repeatability and automation. These measures helped reduce config debt, allowing organizations to fully leverage cloud computing’s benefits while effectively managing its challenges.
## Kubernetes: Taming the Cloud With Orchestration
Kubernetes automated the deployment of
[containerized applications](https://thenewstack.io/containers/), scaling and operation, allowing developers to concentrate on application development rather than infrastructure.
Despite its benefits,
[Kubernetes introduced complexities in configuration management](https://thenewstack.io/managing-kubernetes-complexity-in-multicloud-environments/), with the potential for significant configuration debt because of inconsistent best practices.
The Kubernetes community developed tools and practices such as Helm charts for package management, operators for automated application management and
[Infrastructure as Code](https://thenewstack.io/infrastructure-as-code/) (IaC) tools like [Terraform](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-manage-cloud-services-with-terraform/), alongside [CI/CD pipelines](https://thenewstack.io/ci-cd/) for efficient configuration.
## Parallels With the AI Revolution
AI development parallels the rapid growth of cloud services and Kubernetes, promising to revolutionize business operations with new capabilities like enhanced decision-making and task automation.
However, this swift advancement can lead to another cycle of accumulating config tech debt, as we saw with the cloud and Kubernetes. AI systems have enormous configuration complexity: AI tech stacks, algorithms, data pipelines and models must be configured correctly for optimal performance, scalability and security.
Misconfigurations in the AI tech stack lead to mismanaged
[data ingestion pipelines](https://thenewstack.io/7-tips-for-building-fast-scalable-cost-efficient-streaming-data-pipelines/), inefficient model training and inadequate security measures. Addressing these challenges requires not repeating the mistakes from our cloud and Kubernetes experiences.
## Lessons Learned and the Path Forward
The evolution of cloud computing and Kubernetes offers vital lessons for AI development. It highlights the need for strategic planning, including tool selection and best practices in configuration management, to avoid config debt and ensure system scalability and security.
Implementing automation and IaC will reduce manual errors and make configurations more reliable and auditable. Effective governance and clear configuration management policies are crucial for maintaining system integrity and compliance, especially in fast-paced AI innovations.
Fostering a collaboration and knowledge-sharing community akin to the Kubernetes ecosystem is essential. By leveraging these lessons, the AI development path becomes more apparent, enabling technology to achieve its transformative potential while avoiding technical debt.
## Strategies to Avoid Config Debt in AI
To avoid configuration debt in AI development, organizations can learn from
[cloud computing and Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/the-status-of-cloud-native-computing-and-kubernetes-today/) by emphasizing strategic planning, automation and a culture of continuous learning.
![Eliminate Misconfigurations: AI Config-as-a-Platform:5% of embedded AI failures are due to misconfigurations. Resource tuning is complicated and manual. Proven “golden config” templates enable automation.](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2024/05/e14ee313-misconfig.jpg)
AI configuration as a platform, in a nutshell.
Automation reduces manual errors and ensures consistent, reliable configurations through tools that support IaC. Establishing clear governance policies across AI projects streamlines configuration management and adheres to best practices, minimizing config debt risks.
[CloudTruth](https://www.cloudtruth.com/)‘s co-founder, Greg Arnette, says, “Based on research interviews with over a thousand engineering leaders, I believe that a must-have solution for the new AI era is a comprehensive secrets and config data orchestration solution that manages, audits, secures and versions AI-stack configurations and secrets. AI systems are complicated to configure and maintain, and expensive to operate because they consume many cloud resources and handle sensitive company data.”
Cultivating a culture that prioritizes ongoing improvement helps teams stay abreast of the latest technologies. Implementing these strategies ensures effective and efficient AI systems management, free from the burdens of configuration debt.
## Conclusion: Steering the AI Revolution With Wisdom From the Past
A clear pattern emerges connecting the rise of cloud and Kubernetes with the rise of artificial intelligence technologies — rapid innovation followed by the realization of accrued configuration technical debt that will sabotage successful deployments.
Organizations can mitigate config debt by adopting standardized tooling, governance frameworks and collaborative practices prioritizing simplicity and automation. This ensures AI systems are scalable, secure and capable of fulfilling their transformative potential.
Remember that configuration data is “load bearing” in your AI infrastructure stack. Given that secrets and variables are mission-critical, config errors statistically cause more outages and breaches than any other type of software bug.
A must-have for every team is a solution that comprehensively manages, audits, secures and versions this data without requiring a ton of rework.
