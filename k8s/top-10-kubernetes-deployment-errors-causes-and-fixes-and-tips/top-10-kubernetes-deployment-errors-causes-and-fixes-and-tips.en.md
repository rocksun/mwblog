When your [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/) deployment fails, it can feel like finding a needle in a haystack. One small error — a missing field, a mistyped image name or not enough memory — can bring everything to a halt. You might be surprised to know that misconfigurations are the root cause of up to 80% of Kubernetes security and stability issues.

Understand why Kubernetes deployment errors happen and exactly how to troubleshoot them. Whether you’re dealing with CrashLoopBackOff, stuck pods or YAML issues, we’ll walk through 10 common problems and give you simple ways to prevent them in the future.

## **Why Kubernetes Deployment Errors Happen: 3 Key Reasons**

Kubernetes helps you run applications in [containers](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-containers/), but even small mistakes in setup can cause big problems. Most issues happen because something isn’t configured right or your cluster doesn’t have enough resources. Let’s look at a few common reasons why deployments fail.

### **Declarative Config Gone Wrong**

Kubernetes uses [YAML files](https://thenewstack.io/with-yamlscript-yaml-becomes-a-proper-programming-language/) to define what your app should look like. This is called a declarative configuration. But if there’s even a small error in that file — like a typo, wrong indentation or missing field — your app won’t deploy correctly.

Also, sometimes the file is valid YAML but not valid for Kubernetes. For example, you might forget to set the number of replicas or point to a service that doesn’t exist yet. These little mistakes can be hard to catch but easy to fix once you spot them.

### **Image and Resource Constraints**

Your container image is the app that Kubernetes runs. If the image name is wrong or the image isn’t pushed to a registry, Kubernetes can’t pull it, and your app won’t start. Another common issue is not setting enough CPU or memory for your [pods](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-building-blocks-nodes-pods-clusters/). If a pod asks for more than what’s available, Kubernetes might delay it or keep it in a “Pending” state.

### **Node and Cluster-Level Issues**

Sometimes the problem isn’t with your app — it’s with the cluster itself. If nodes are full, offline or having issues, your app might not have anywhere to run. There can also be problems with the cluster’s networking or storage setup. For example, a pod might not connect to other services, or it might crash if storage isn’t available.

## **Top 10 Kubernetes Deployment Errors and How to Troubleshoot Them**

When something goes wrong in a [Kubernetes deployment](https://thenewstack.io/a-look-at-kubernetes-deployment/), it can feel confusing at first. But many errors are common and have clear causes. Here are 10 of the most frequent errors you might see and how to fix them.

### **1. CrashLoopBackOff**

This error means a pod starts, crashes and then tries to restart again and again. It usually happens when the app inside the container fails right after starting.

**How to troubleshoot:**

* Run *kubectl logs <pod-name>* to see why the app is crashing.
* Check your startup command or environment variables.
* Make sure any required files, services or dependencies are available.

### **2. ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull**

These errors show up when Kubernetes can’t download your container image. It could be because the image name is wrong, the registry needs a login or the image doesn’t exist.

**How to troubleshoot:**

* Check the image name and tag in your YAML file.
* Make sure the image is pushed to the container registry.
* If it’s a private registry, add a valid image pull secret.

### **3. OOMKilled**

OOM stands for out of memory. This error means your container used more memory than allowed and was shut down by the system.

**How to troubleshoot:**

* Increase the memory limit in your deployment file.
* Optimize your app to use less memory.
* Use *kubectl describe pod <pod-name>* to check memory limits and usage.

### **4. CreateContainerConfigError**

This error means something in your pod’s setup is wrong. It can be a bad secret, config map or volume.

**How to troubleshoot:**

* Use *kubectl describe pod <pod-name>* to see detailed error messages.
* Check if secrets, config maps, or volumes are referenced in the [YAML](https://thenewstack.io/yall-against-my-lingo-why-everyone-hates-on-yaml/).
* Make sure paths and keys are correct.

### **5. NodeNotReady**

This error means a node in your cluster is not available to run pods. It could be down or disconnected.

**How to troubleshoot:**

* Use *kubectl get nodes* to check node status.
* Look at *kubectl describe node <node-name>* for more info.
* Restart or fix the node, depending on the issue.

### **6. Pod Stuck in Pending**

A pod in the “Pending” state hasn’t started yet. This usually means there aren’t enough resources (CPU or memory) or a volume isn’t available.

**How to troubleshoot:**

* Run *kubectl describe pod <pod-name>* to find out why it’s pending.
* Check if your cluster has enough free resources.
* Make sure storage volumes or node selectors are correct.

### **7. FailedScheduling**

This error means Kubernetes couldn’t find a node that fits your pod’s requirements. It often relates to resource limits or scheduling rules.

**How to troubleshoot:**

* Use *kubectl describe pod <pod-name>* to see scheduling details.
* Reduce CPU or memory requests in your pod spec.
* Check if you’re using any node selectors or taints that might block scheduling.

### **8. ContainerCannotRun**

This means the container failed to start at all. It could be because the entrypoint command is wrong or the container doesn’t have the needed permissions.

**How to troubleshoot:**

* Use *kubectl logs <pod-name>* or describe pod to view errors.
* Make sure the command and arguments in your YAML are correct.
* Check for missing files, broken permissions or required access rights.

### **9. Exit Code 1 / 125**

These exit codes mean your app failed right after starting. Code 1 usually means a general error. Code 125 can mean the container command failed before the app even ran.

**How to troubleshoot:**

* Use *kubectl logs <pod-name>* to see error output.
* Double-check your entry command, environment variables and dependencies.
* Try running the image locally with docker run to test it.

### **10. Pods in Init / Waiting Loop**

Sometimes pods stay in the “Init” or “Waiting” state for too long. This happens when init containers or the main container can’t start properly.

**How to troubleshoot:**

* Use *kubectl describe pod <pod-name>* to check what’s holding things up.
* Make sure init containers complete successfully.
* Check image names, volume mounts and startup scripts.

## **A General Troubleshooting Framework**

When something goes wrong in Kubernetes, it helps to follow a step-by-step approach. Instead of guessing, use the tools built into Kubernetes to figure out what’s happening.

Here’s a simple framework to guide your troubleshooting:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step** | **What it helps with** | **Tool or command** |
| **kubectl describe** | See pod status, events and error messages | *kubectl describe pod <pod-name>* |
| **Check events and logs** | Understand what Kubernetes is doing and app behavior | *kubectl get events, kubectl logs* |
| **Dry run** | Catch YAML errors before they affect *the cluster* | *kubectl apply –dry-run=client* |
| **Resource monitoring** | Identify memory / CPU problems | *kubectl top pod* or dashboard tools |
| **Health probes** | Ensure apps are working and ready to receive traffic | Liveness and readiness probes in YAML |

### Start With `kubectl describe`

The *kubectl describe* command gives a full breakdown of what’s going on with a pod, node or other resource. It shows the current status, any error messages and related events. This should be your first stop to get clues about the problem.

### **Check Events and Logs**

Events tell you what Kubernetes has been trying to do, like scheduling a pod or pulling an image. Logs show what your app or container is actually doing. Use *kubectl get events* for the big picture and *kubectl logs <pod-name>* to look inside the container.

### **Validate YAMLs With Dry Run**

Small typos or bad formatting in your YAML files can cause big issues. Use *kubectl apply –dry-run=client -f <file>.yaml* to check your config before applying it. This helps catch mistakes early without changing anything in your cluster.

### **Monitor Resource Usage**

Check how much [CPU and memory](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-choose-the-right-cloud-cpu-for-your-workload/) your pods are using with tools like *kubectl top* or metrics dashboards. If pods don’t have enough resources — or are asking for too much — they may crash, get stuck or be killed by the system.

### **Use Probes and Health Checks**

Liveness and readiness probes help Kubernetes know when your app is healthy and ready to serve traffic. If these are missing or set up incorrectly, pods may restart too often or receive traffic before they’re ready. Adding proper health checks makes your app more stable.

## **Pro Tips for Preventing Future Errors**

Once you’ve fixed common Kubernetes issues, the next step is to stop them from happening again. A few smart habits can go a long way in keeping your deployments smooth and stress-free.

### **Automate Linting and Validation**

Use tools that check your YAML files for mistakes before you deploy. Linters can catch missing fields, bad formatting or invalid values. Automating this step in your [CI/CD pipeline](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-ci-cd-pipelines-explained/) helps you catch issues early, before they hit production.

**Helpful tools for YAML linting and validation:**

* Kubeval
* kube-linter
* Datree
* kubectl –dry-run

### **Use Resource Requests and Limits Wisely**

Always set CPU and memory requests and limits for your containers. This helps Kubernetes schedule your pods correctly and protects your cluster from one pod using too many resources. But don’t guess — start small and adjust based on actual usage.

**Tips for setting resource requests and limits:**

* Start with small default values (e.g., 100m CPU, 128Mi memory) and monitor usage.
* Use *kubectl top pod* or metrics dashboards to view actual resource consumption.
* Set both requests (minimum needed) and limits (maximum allowed).
* Avoid setting limits too low since it may cause your app to crash or restart.

### **Implement Observability Tools**

Add tools that let you see what’s happening in your cluster in real time. Dashboards and monitoring solutions help you catch problems faster and make it easier to understand overall performance.

**Popular observability tools for Kubernetes:**

* [Prometheus](https://thenewstack.io/prometheus-at-10-whats-been-its-impact-on-observability/) + Grafana
* Kube-state-metrics
* Loki for log aggregation
* Jaeger for tracing
* Datadog, [New Relic](https://thenewstack.io/new-relics-intelligent-observability-platform-is-ambitious/) or Dynatrace for all-in-one monitoring

## **Wrapping Up: Stay Ahead of Kubernetes Deployment Issues**

Deployment errors in Kubernetes can slow down your teams, waste resources and cause unnecessary downtime. That’s why understanding common issues — and knowing how to fix or prevent them — is such a valuable skill for anyone working with containers and clusters.

By using tools that catch problems early, setting smart resource limits and keeping a close eye on your environment, you can avoid most headaches before they start. And when it’s time to clean up older or broken deployments, it’s just as important to do it the right way.
