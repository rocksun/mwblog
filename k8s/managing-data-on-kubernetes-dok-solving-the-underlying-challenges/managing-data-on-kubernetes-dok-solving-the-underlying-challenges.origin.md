In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, staying ahead requires agility, flexibility and scalability. This is precisely where [data on Kubernetes (DoK)](https://community.cncf.io/data-on-kubernetes/) becomes a game-changer for enterprises. As the industry continues to [embrace Kubernetes](https://roadmap.sh/kubernetes), it is evident that leveraging DoK is essential for keeping pace with modern demands.

Recent research commissioned by Portworx by Pure Storage, encapsulated in the [2024 Voice of Kubernetes Experts Report](https://portworx.com/resources/voice-of-kubernetes-expert-report/?utm_source=newstack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=px-brand), underscores the transformative impact of DoK. Surveying over 500 Kubernetes experts from large organizations, the report highlights several key trends and challenges that are shaping the future of enterprise [data management](https://thenewstack.io/storage/).

## Key Benefits of Data on Kubernetes
Data on Kubernetes (DoK) refers to the trend within modern enterprises that specifically run stateful workloads in [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/), and these enterprise workloads are defined as data-centric, data-intensive or mission-critical for an organization’s business. Since these mission-critical workloads have run in virtual machines over the past couple of decades, the adoption of DoK represents the maturity that Kubernetes has gained rapidly in the past five years or so.

The advantages of DoK are clear: it offers unmatched flexibility, scalability and cost-effectiveness. According to the report, 65% of organizations identify faster deployments as the primary benefit of running data services or workloads on Kubernetes.

As businesses increasingly [adopt cloud native environments](https://thenewstack.io/enterprises-to-double-cloud-native-use-by-2029), they often start with stateless workloads before progressing to more complex stateful applications. This evolution — from initial small projects to mission-critical applications — reflects Kubernetes’ growing role as a cornerstone of enterprise strategy.

## Current DoK Trends, Types of Workloads and Challenges
The report reveals that 97% of organizations are now running data-intensive workloads on Kubernetes. Among these, 72% utilize Kubernetes for database management, 67% for analytics and 54% for AI/ML workloads. This broad adoption signifies a substantial shift towards cloud native solutions for critical operations.

However, as Kubernetes continues to mature, so do the challenges associated with it. High availability and disaster recovery are top concerns for 52% of organizations, while 46% struggle with high-performance storage. Additionally, 71% of respondents express a need for a [centralized platform](https://thenewstack.io/execs-invest-in-platform-engineering-heres-why/) to streamline operations and address these challenges effectively.

## The Path Forward
To fully leverage the benefits of DoK while mitigating its complexities, enterprises must adopt a comprehensive container data management platform. The key requirements include:

**High-performance persistent storage:**Essential for supporting modern applications with demanding performance needs.**Automated storage processes:**Streamlining operations through automation and offering developers a self-service experience.**Enterprise-grade business continuity:**Implementing robust data protection and disaster recovery policies to safeguard mission-critical applications.**Unified data platform:**A centralized solution that simplifies management across hybrid cloud and multicloud environments and integrates seamlessly with modern databases.
The question for enterprises is not whether to run data on Kubernetes but how to effectively address the associated challenges. By investing in the right technologies and strategies, businesses can unlock the full potential of DoK, ensuring their infrastructure scales with the demands of the future.
