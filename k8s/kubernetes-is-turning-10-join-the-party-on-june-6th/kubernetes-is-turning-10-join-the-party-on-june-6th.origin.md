Over the last 10 years,
[Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) has risen to become the backbone of modern application deployment and has completely changed the course of innovation.
Kubernetes was the first project
[accepted](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2016/03/10/cloud-native-computing-foundation-accepts-kubernetes-as-first-hosted-project-technical-oversight-committee-elected/) into the CNCF Incubator in March 2016 and remains a top open source project. Kubernetes not only shattered expectations for itself but it set a North Star for the entire CNCF ecosystem. CNCF has since grown to more than 184 cloud native projects and the success of Kubernetes in the CNCF established a baseline of what was possible for others.
Kubernetes is today the de facto standard to deploy and operate containerized applications. Originally developed at Google and released as open source in 2014, Kubernetes builds on 15 years of running Google’s containerized workloads and the valuable contributions from the open source community. Kubernetes makes everything associated with deploying and managing applications easier.
[On June 6](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kuber10es-birthday-bash/), the Kubernetes and cloud native community will come together across the globe to celebrate a tremendous decade and look forward to the next #KuberTENes. Everyone in the community will have a chance to #celebr8k8s in the following ways.
**KuberTENes Birthday Bash**
Join us for a fun and memorable in-person event at Google’s
[Bay View Campus](https://realestate.withgoogle.com/bayview) in Mountain View, California to celebrate on June 6th.
The birthday bash will blend elements of a reunion show, while celebrating many hidden figures that made this project possible, and a preview into what awaits us in the next 10 years. We’ll celebrate people who have been integral in shaping Kubernetes into what it is today, and discuss why its significance will only grow in the years ahead.
Interested in attending? We would love to have you. Tickets are free but space is limited so
[RSVP](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kuber10es-birthday-bash/) soon!
**Birthday Bash Livestream/Replays**

**KuberTENes Birthday Party in a Box & Local Meet-Ups**
