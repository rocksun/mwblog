Trying to set resource requests and limits in [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/) is kind of like the story of “Goldilocks and the Three Bears”: Overprovisioning gives developers abundant compute, but it wastes money, energy and other resources. Underprovision and you slow down developers, leaving them frustrated and likely costing you money as it takes longer to ship new products and features.

Improperly configured resources can lead to application instability, poor cluster utilization and performance issues. The [platform engineering team](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/)’s goal is to get to “just right” — to give developers the right amount of resources — plenty to meet their needs without overprovisioning and wasting money.

While managing application resources is more often considered an ops concern, the truth is resource consumption is just as important in application development as security or reliability. Having visibility into an application’s resource utilization, cost and efficiency enables devs to make informed decisions — but they don’t want to spend time fine-tuning CPU/memory requests or autoscaling configs. And they definitely don’t want to become Kubernetes experts — they just want to build and ship features without extra hassles.

This is where a reliable, efficient and automated Kubernetes resource management system becomes so valuable for teams. It right-sizes resources, abstracts complexity and reduces unnecessary friction for developers building and shipping software.

## How To Build a ‘Just Right’ K8s Resource Management System

If you’re trying to solve your own Kubernetes resource challenges, join us on Oct. 21 at 11 a.m. PT | 2 p.m. ET for a special online event, [Automating K8s Resource Management To Reduce Developer Burden](https://thenewstack.io/webinar/automating-k8s-resource-management-to-reduce-developer-burden/).

During this free webinar, [Andrew Hillier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewhillier/), co-founder and CTO of [Densify](https://www.densify.com/?utm_content=inline+mention), and TNS Host [Chris Pirillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrispirillo/) will explore resource management challenges and offer practical steps platform teams can take to gain visibility into risks and inefficiencies, set optimal resource specs, automate scaling and foster better collaboration with application teams.

## Register for This Free Webinar Today!

If you can’t join us live, register anyway and we’ll send you a recording following the webinar.

## What You’ll Learn

By attending this special online event, you’ll leave with best practices, real-world examples and actionable tips, including:

* Understand the typical cost and risk factors impacting Kubernetes environments.
* Apply policy-based approaches to automatically optimize container requests and limits.
* See why continuous node capacity and scaling optimization are critical.
