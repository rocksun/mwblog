Seeking higher performance, lower latency and stronger privacy, enterprises are exploring the [possibilities of edge computing](https://thenewstack.io/edge-computing/). But critical challenges underlie these benefits, including limited computing resources and unreliable connectivity. Moreover, because many edge end users are not technologists, security and remediation are particularly difficult.

These challenges help explain why containerization is becoming an increasingly popular method for deploying software at the edge.

However, while containers are well-established in the data center, and [Kubernetes is the de facto standard](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/) for orchestrating those containers, it’s an entirely different game at the edge. How do you maintain control, ensure security and simplify management across a distributed fleet of devices?

If you’re seeking answers to these issues, you’ll want to preregister for our upcoming ebook, [Kubernetes at the Edge: Container Orchestration at Scale](https://thenewstack.io/ebooks/kubernetes/kubernetes-at-the-edge-container-orchestration-at-scale/), available in mid-September.

## What You’ll Learn

Written by IT veteran and ex-CTO Charles Humble in partnership with Sidero Labs, “Kubernetes at the Edge” gives you the knowledge, resources and proven strategies to deploy and manage Kubernetes at the edge with confidence.

In this ebook, you’ll discover:

* The meaning of edge computing, including the differences between near edge, far edge and device edge, and how “the edge” spans from regional data centers to individual sensors.
* Actionable best practices for building a robust and resilient edge infrastructure.
* Real-world use cases showing how companies are leveraging the edge for AI, sustainability and more.
* A market survey of leading Kubernetes edge vendors to help you choose the right platform.
* The “how-to” blueprint for assembling your team and deploying Kubernetes at the edge without disrupting your current operations.

## Why You Should Read This

As Charles writes, “The edge isn’t simply ‘cloud computing, but closer.’ Rather, it extends cloud native practices to locations where traditional cloud assumptions break down.” This means that the practices you’ve become accustomed to in the cloud may not apply in the same way at the edge.

This comprehensive ebook delivers the expert insights you need to navigate the complexities, evaluate the vendors and master the best practices for edge computing with K8s.
