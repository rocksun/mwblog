Kubernetes has fundamentally transformed how organizations deploy and manage containerized applications in cloud environments. However, while [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/) enables organizations to scale and manage their cloud native applications efficiently, it has its own set of complexities.

Some fundamental concepts of [DevOps](https://roadmap.sh/devops), like automated CI/CD workflows, serve as the foundation for delivering applications to Kubernetes environments. However, as an organization starts to scale its services, these traditional CI/CD workflows, with their simpler build, test and deploy approach, become inefficient.

As at-scale organizations begin dealing with multiple [microservices](https://thenewstack.io/microservices/what-is-microservices-architecture/), git branches and Kubernetes environments (i.e., dev, stage and production), managing these complex components using traditional CI/CD frameworks becomes cumbersome due to the asynchronous nature of Kubernetes deployments.

GitOps tools like [Argo CD](https://thenewstack.io/how-far-can-you-go-with-argo/), which accelerate application delivery in Kubernetes environments, are capable of deploying changes from git repositories to target environments. However, they struggle with understanding how to progressively promote applications across multiple environments and deployment targets.

## Application Deployment in Kubernetes Environments
Every software follows a progressive deployment path through development and staging environments before reaching the production environment. At every stage, the service is tested and validated to ensure smooth operations. [CI/CD](https://thenewstack.io/ci-cd/) pipelines are the fundamental mechanism driving these systematic environment transitions and validations. However, traditional CI/CD pipelines are limited when it comes to managing large-scale deployments to multiple environments.

### Continuous Integration
CI is a software development practice where developers merge their code changes into a central git repository, followed by automated builds and tests. Developers commit their code to the main branch multiple times per day, due to the DevOps preference for making small, incremental changes.

The CI stage is generally handled through tools like Jenkins and GitHub Actions in the cloud native ecosystem. These CI tools enable developers to write custom scripts that automatically run the test cases and produce artifacts ready for deployment. However, due to their flexibility, these CI tools are often used for executing CD pipeline tasks, which they are not meant for. The CI stage should generally be small in scope: The task should only be to test and build the artifact out of raw code.

### Continuous Deployment
CD is the automated process of delivering code changes from a repository to various environments, ultimately reaching production. The CD pipeline typically progresses through development, testing and staging environments before finally reaching production. At each stage, the application undergoes specific validations and tests. For example, in the development environment, developers can verify new features and fixes, while the staging environment mimics production conditions for thorough testing. Only after passing all quality gates and approvals does the code move to production.

To ensure reliable deployments, CD pipelines rely heavily on automation and the [GitOps approach](https://thenewstack.io/4-core-principles-of-gitops/) to ensure consistent and repeatable deployments. The automated GitOps approach allows teams to deliver code and configuration changes quickly and efficiently. The scope and complexity of CD pipelines significantly exceed that of CI pipelines, encompassing orchestrated deployments across multiple environments, progressive deployment strategies and automated rollback mechanisms to handle deployment failures.

## Complexities of Cloud Native Deployments
As the organization moves towards the [cloud native approach](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native/10-key-attributes-of-cloud-native-applications/) to ensure the high availability of its services, the complexities of traditional CI/CD systems intensify due to the microservice architecture and dynamic nature of cloud native technologies. Each microservice and deployment environment comes with specific requirements and dependencies, which increases deployment complexities.

The complexities of multiple microservice dependencies and dynamic environments slow down teams’ operations because they have to ensure the consistency of configuration at each point. The complexities also increase the chances of misconfigurations and errors in deployments, which may lead to downtime in production systems.

Traditional CI/CD pipelines and the GitOps approach create challenges like:

- The accelerating pace of software development overwhelms traditional CI/CD infrastructure, which wasn’t designed for high-frequency deployments. This creates bottlenecks for critical deployments and leads to potential downtime.
- Traditional CI/CD pipelines and GitOps approaches require constant maintenance to ensure security and compliance. Tools like Argo CD instances need ongoing management, introducing additional delays in the deployment process.
- Organizations must maintain multiple CI/CD pipelines and Argo CD instances to execute deployments across different environments. Managing numerous pipelines (imagine 10 different microservices across four environments) becomes increasingly complex and time-consuming.
- The need to integrate additional tools for monitoring and rollback processes creates tool sprawl, further complicating the deployment infrastructure.
- Organizations rely on scripts executed during the CI stage to promote the code changes to the next stage, leading to CI pipeline overload.
- The complexity of managing multiple environments, microservices and CI/CD pipelines creates version-tracking challenges, making it difficult to maintain deployment accuracy across environments.
- The sprawl of tools and environments significantly complicates the audit process, making maintaining deployment transparency and accountability challenging.
## Application Promotion to Simplify Kubernetes Deployments
Application promotion is the process of progressively deploying an application through the different environments of the software deployment pipeline, such as the development, quality assurance (QA), staging and production environments. This progression of the application through multiple environments helps ensure that the application runs smoothly and that the features and changes are thoroughly validated through multiple environments. After meeting certain requirements such as passing test cases, the application can progress to the next environment.

Adopting application promotion simplifies the delivery of multiple microservices to different environments while providing a scalable and flexible approach. It keeps CI/CD and GitOps as the base and fills in the gaps to provide a path designed to handle the pace of software delivery. It is flexible enough to modify according to needs.

Application promotion allows organizations to continuously promote changes in multiple environments: from development, where the developer tests their applications; to staging, which mimics the production environment, and finally to production. Application promotion passes changes according to defined criteria and checks to support release stability.

This approach reduces the risk of errors, misconfigurations and downtime, making each deployment more reliable and efficient. It also increases coordination between development and operations teams, improves deployment predictability, and helps maintain a consistent application state across environments. It also creates a clear audit trail of changes, making it easier to track deployments and roll back if necessary.

Some of the benefits application promotion brings to CI/CD and GitOps pipelines are:

- It provides flexibility and more control over the deployment pipelines, where every change passes through a series of environments and automated checks. Continuous promotion and testing at every stage allow teams to iterate over issues and deliver a stable release in production environments.
- This modern CI/CD approach effectively manages the complexities of multi-environment deployments, enabling organizations to scale their environments and microservices efficiently.
- It enforces standardization across deployment processes, ensuring consistent practices and reducing the likelihood of environment-specific configuration drift.
- It improves visibility into the deployment pipeline, allowing teams to quickly identify bottlenecks and optimize the promotion process.
- It also facilitates rapid rollbacks and recovery procedures by maintaining a clear history of deployments and configurations across environments.
## How Devtron Enables Application Promotion
[Devtron](https://github.com/devtron-labs/devtron) is an open source platform that helps address the complexities of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters, thereby increasing developers’ productivity and making it easier for DevOps teams to manage Kubernetes at scale.
[Devtron’s Application Promotion](https://devtron.ai/blog/application-promotion-in-devtron) feature allows teams to define robust guardrails and policy-driven deployment structures, facilitating the gradual deployment of applications across different environments. This approach helps ensure that applications are rigorously tested at each stage before being promoted to the next environment.
By defining clear criteria for success, teams can confidently verify that their applications meet performance and functionality standards at every level. This minimizes the risk of issues in production and also helps guarantee that applications operate smoothly and reliably.
