KubeCon 2024 features
[new technologies and services](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native-computing-and-ai-a-qa-with-cncfs-head-of-ecosystem/) from the open source and cloud native communities. This year, one company you’ll hear a lot from is [OVHcloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com), a French cloud provider that’s been innovating on data center design and management since 1999.
Now serving more than 1.6 million customers in 140 countries, with 42 data centers and 2,900 employees across four continents, OVHcloud offers solutions for public and private clouds that are accessible, open, transparent, reversible and secure.
OVHcloud has made a splash in recent years with its
[patented liquid cooling system](https://blog.ovhcloud.com/new-hybrid-immersion-liquid-cooling-developments-at-ovhcloud/), thanks to which it can declare that it has one of the lowest power usage effectiveness (PUE) ratings in the industry. OVHcloud has also made a number of noteworthy acquisitions in the last few years, including [gridscale](https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/en/newsroom/news/closing-gridscale-acquisition/) — through which the company has developed new [Local Zones](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/public-cloud/local-zone/), with plans for up to 150 new Local Zones by 2026 to better serve its global customers — and [ForePaaS](https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/en/newsroom/news/acquisition-forepaas/), which led to the development of an interesting new product that is now ready to be revealed.
Naturally, OVHcloud representatives will be at KubeCon 2024 in their native Paris. Here’s a look at what you can expect from the show.
## Help for Kubernetes Cluster Management at Scale
At KubeCon Paris 2024, OVHcloud will announce a new product called OVHcloud Managed Rancher Service, a fully open source, self-service, off-the-shelf platform that companies can use to manage
[Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/) clusters at scale.
Based on
[Rancher](https://documentation.suse.com/trd/kubernetes/single-html/kubernetes_ri_rancher-k3s-slemicro/index.html) and fully operated by OVHcloud, Managed Rancher Service was developed in close partnership with [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/company/about/), a leader in enterprise open source solutions, including SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) and NeuVector. “Together with SUSE, we have the same DNA: We are two European leaders who are open cloud and open source oriented, so it really makes sense to jointly put this in motion,” said [Yaniv Fdida](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaniv-fdida-876b153b/), chief product and technology officer at OVHcloud.
Notably, Managed Rancher Service offers support for multicloud and hybrid cloud scenarios, enabling companies to easily manage and orchestrate K8s clusters, whether they come from public or private clouds, on-premises infrastructure, third parties or other sources.
Fdida said this is what customers have been asking for — and his team is listening. “It’s in response to the multicloud and hybrid cloud requirements and capabilities that our customers wanted,” he explained. “Rancher will help them manage their workloads and orchestrate their K8s clusters across different capacities, whether that’s inside our cloud, as a part of a hybrid solution with our cloud and their own on-premises facility, or even with other service providers.”
Managed Rancher Service is now available in OVHcloud’s public cloud universe in beta version.
## A New Perspective of the Data Journey
[OVHcloud acquired ForePaaS two years ago](https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/en/newsroom/news/acquisition-forepaas/), and KubeCon Paris 2024 is where the two companies will reveal their offspring in the form of OVHcloud Data Platform.
Jointly realized with ForePaaS, Data Platform is an end-to-end,
[low-code platform](https://thenewstack.io/yes-your-enterprise-needs-low-code-now/) that’s intended to help companies manage the data pipeline of analytics in their data journeys. “It’s directly connected to all our products,” Fdida said. “Our storage engines on databases in the public cloud and on object storage in the public cloud. It’s about helping our customers answer that question, ‘How can I get benefits from my data?'”
More specifically, Data Platform will help companies collect, manage, store, analyze and visualize data, giving them a complete perspective of their data’s journey in the cloud and a smooth, seamless approach to data journey management and manipulation. Fdida also pointed out that OVHcloud is a trusted cloud provider that doesn’t expose any loads, helping ensure that its customers’ data is fully secured from any unauthorized access or breaches.
Particularly for AI use cases, Data Platform may be a standout product. After all: “Data is gold,” Fdida said. “It’s the gold of getting benefits for new AI uses.” (And he’s not the only one dubbing data “
[the new currency](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/03/27/how-to-make-use-of-the-new-gold-data/?sh=3e3d40602bbf).”) So if Data Platform helps customers better manipulate data, it may be the new option companies need for today’s data gold rush.
## An Expanding Roadmap for the Public Cloud
With more than 40 products and solutions spanning eight services (security, compute, storage, database, network services, analytics, artificial intelligence and quantum), OVHcloud has already carved out an impressive path in the public cloud industry — and there’s much more to come.
At KubeCon Paris 2024, the cloud company shares its plan to expand further with a slew of upcoming product announcements, including:
- Two new storage offerings for the public cloud
- New compute capabilities in different aspects, including new GPU capabilities
- New AI solutions
- Two new products on its cloud key management system to improve security and interoperability
## Ongoing Support for Cloud Native Transformation
By 2025, more than 85% of organizations will have a cloud-first strategy,
[Gartner predicted](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-11-10-gartner-says-cloud-will-be-the-centerpiece-of-new-digital-experiences).
It’s easy to see why. A
[recent Gitnux report](https://gitnux.org/cloud-cost-savings-statistics/) said that 84% of businesses that adopt cloud technology reduce computing costs — and then stand to reduce their energy-consumption costs by 30 to 60% thanks to cloud tech.
Fdida’s team knows its customers are in the middle of cloud native transformations and he stressed that these announcements are the direct outcome of their customer conversations. As he explained, “They were asking how they can modernize infrastructure and manage the complexity of orchestrating different types of workloads in different environments.”
This is a particular challenge for companies operating multiple K8s clusters in data centers across multiple service providers, as
[K8s cluster management is notoriously complex](https://thenewstack.io/why-kubernetes-cluster-management-needs-to-be-easier-for-developers/). According to Fdida, OVHcloud’s customers needed an accessible, reversible, transparent solution to make K8s management and orchestration easier without sacrificing freedom of choice. Rancher was developed to address these requirements.
Data Platform, meanwhile, gives OVHcloud’s customers a user-friendly interface to better manage the complete data journey, from data collection to visualization. The beta version is launching at the beginning of April, in the footsteps of the well-received alpha version.
So, for OVHcloud customers, getting new public cloud offerings is perhaps as simple as: “Ask and you shall receive.”
