In 2024, economic pressures have intensified, making cloud cost efficiency a top priority for organisations across industries. According to the [FinOps Foundationâ€™s latest insights](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), reducing waste and managing commitment-based discounts â€” such as Reserved Instances or Savings Plans â€” have become the top priorities for FinOps practitioners, reflecting a shift from empowering engineers to directly managing financial outcomes.

In this article, weâ€™ll explore the five essential cloud cost metrics every team should be tracking. These metrics align with current FinOps priorities and provide a foundation for efficient cloud operations in an increasingly cost-conscious environment.

# Cost by Environment
Understanding how cloud costs are distributed across environments, such as production, staging, and development, is critical for managing your cloud spend effectively. Non-production environments often contain inefficiencies, like idle resources or over-provisioned instances, that can inflate your costs without contributing to business value. Tracking costs by environment helps ensure critical environments like production remain optimised while identifying savings opportunities elsewhere.

## What Happens If You Donâ€™t Track It:
Without tracking costs by environment, non-production environments like staging or development can consume excessive resources unnoticed. This can lead to bloated budgets, inefficient use of cloud resources, and difficulty justifying cloud spending to stakeholders. Additionally, production costs may spiral due to lack of prioritisation or oversight.

## Action
Establish budgets for each environment using cloud-native tools and track actual spend against these budgets. Configure alerts to notify stakeholders when spending approaches or exceeds thresholds, enabling proactive management.

## Example Visualisation
# Cost by Resource Type
Breaking down cloud costs by resource type â€” such as compute, storage, and networking â€” is essential for pinpointing inefficiencies and managing resource utilisation effectively. Different resource types often have varying cost structures, and understanding these can help teams identify areas where spending can be reduced or optimised.

## What Happens If You Donâ€™t Track It:
Failing to monitor costs by resource type makes it nearly impossible to identify inefficiencies, like oversized compute instances or unused storage. This can result in unchecked spending on underutilised resources, reduced ROI, and missed opportunities for optimisation. Teams may also struggle to allocate budgets effectively across different workloads.

## Action
Categorise your cloud resources by type and monitor their associated costs using cloud-native tools or centralised dashboards. Use this data to identify underutilised resources, rightsize workloads, or shift to more cost-effective resource configurations.

## Example Visualisation
# Advisor Cost Recommendations
Cloud platforms offer optimisation recommendations, such as rightsizing instances, deleting idle resources, or shifting to commitment-based pricing models. Acting on these recommendations ensures your organisation operates efficiently and minimises unnecessary expenses.

## What Happens If You Donâ€™t Track It:
Ignoring cost-saving recommendations means your organisation is leaving money on the table. Without acting on insights like rightsizing or idle resource elimination, you risk overspending, underutilising resources, and failing to meet financial goals. Over time, inefficiencies compound, making cost optimisation even harder.

## Action
Leverage cloud-native advisor tools to access cost-saving recommendations. Regularly review these insights and prioritise actions based on potential savings and implementation effort. Create a simple process or report to track recommendations and their status, enabling better visibility for ongoing improvements.

## Example Visualisation
# Budgets by Application
Setting budgets at the application level is critical for maintaining cost accountability across teams and ensuring financial control. By allocating specific budgets for applications, teams can monitor spending, identify anomalies, and ensure resources are used efficiently.

## What Happens If You Donâ€™t Track It:
Without application-level budgets, spending becomes opaque and unaccountable. Teams may exceed budgets without realising it, leading to runaway costs and difficulty aligning application spend with business value. This lack of control can also strain relationships between finance, operations, and engineering teams.

## Action
Define budgets for each application using cloud-native tools, and track actual spending against these budgets. Set up automated alerts to notify stakeholders when spending is nearing or exceeding limits, allowing for timely intervention.

## Example Visualisation
# Forecasted Spend
Forecasting cloud spend is essential for proactive financial planning and avoiding surprises. By predicting future costs based on historical usage trends and upcoming projects, organisations can align budgets with business growth and prevent budget overruns.

## What Happens If You Donâ€™t Track It:
Failing to forecast cloud spend exposes your organisation to unexpected cost spikes that disrupt budgets and hinder financial planning. Without predictions, teams canâ€™t anticipate or mitigate growing costs, making it difficult to scale resources in line with business growth. This reactive approach increases the risk of budget overruns.

## Action
Use predictive features in cloud-native tools to model expected costs. Incorporate factors such as seasonal demand, upcoming projects, and historical trends to create accurate forecasts. Regularly review forecasts to align spending expectations with actual usage trends. If forecasts are not yet accurate, use historical data and known upcoming changes to improve estimates over time, gradually refining the process.

# Conclusion
Effective cloud cost management is no longer optional â€” itâ€™s essential for organisations looking to optimise their resources, reduce waste, and maintain financial control in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. By focusing on the five essential metrics outlined in this article â€” **Cost by Environment**, **Cost by Resource Type**, **Advisor Cost Recommendations**, **Budgets by Application**, and **Forecasted Spend** â€” teams can gain the insights needed to take proactive control of their cloud expenses.

Tracking these metrics ensures accountability, highlights inefficiencies, and provides a roadmap for strategic decision-making. Itâ€™s not just about cutting costs â€” itâ€™s about aligning spending with business priorities and unlocking the full value of your cloud investments.
