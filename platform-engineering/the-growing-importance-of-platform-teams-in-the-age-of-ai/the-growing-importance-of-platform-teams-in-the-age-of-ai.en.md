Platform teams have emerged as a crucial component in modern software development, bridging the gap between development and operations, streamlining processes, and enhancing productivity.

Before becoming essential in modern software development, platform teams were often viewed as optional support units, primarily focused on maintaining infrastructure and providing basic tools for developers.

The adoption of cloud technology, growing software complexity, and increased market competition have highlighted the need for streamlined processes and [improved developer productivity](https://thenewstack.io/developer-productivity-metrics-drive-continuous-improvement/). Their impact extends far beyond mere technical improvements, influencing organizational culture, product quality, and business outcomes.

By providing standardized tools, workflows, and infrastructure, platform teams enable developers to focus on creating value rather than [grappling with operational](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-implement-innersource-with-an-internal-developer-portal/) complexities. This shift not only accelerates development cycles but also fosters innovation and improves the overall quality of software products.

## The Evolution and Impact of Platform Teams

Change is difficult, but it is necessary for evolution and progress. One of the most significant impacts of platform teams is their ability to drive cultural change within an organization. By promoting best practices, encouraging collaboration, and breaking down silos between departments, platform teams create an environment of continuous improvement and shared responsibility.

This cultural shift often leads to increased job satisfaction among developers. They feel empowered to make decisions and contribute meaningfully to the product’s success.

At Jooble, the platform team identified a critical challenge in the release process. The manual, time-consuming process took 3-4 hours, and engineers had no ability to run end-to-end (E2E) tests before a release. This meant that quality could only be validated once the A/B test was ready for production release.

Given the scale of Jooble’s user base — 50 million monthly active users — the risk of releasing a test that could break something was high, with potential revenue impacts. If issues were discovered during release, engineers had to cancel the release, fix the bugs, and wait for another available window.

This lengthy process led engineers to avoid frequent releases, creating an incentive to bundle multiple A/B tests into a “big release.” This delayed hypothesis validation, slowed down iteration, and ultimately impacted the speed of innovation.

By automating the release process and enabling engineers to run E2E tests during development, the platform team created a culture of faster, more frequent releases. Engineers no longer had to bundle changes.

Instead, they could release features as soon as they were ready, run quality checks earlier in the process, and iterate more quickly. This shift not only improved the speed of releases but also fostered a culture of rapid hypothesis validation without compromising on quality.

## Beyond Traditional Metrics: Assessing True Impact

Additionally, the standardization introduced by platform teams often results in improved security practices, better compliance with regulations, and more robust disaster recovery processes, all of which contribute to the overall resilience of the organization.

By consolidating tools and infrastructure, companies reduce costs and enhance productivity through automation, leading to faster time-to-market for new products. [Improved reliability and compliance](https://thenewstack.io/a-call-to-use-generative-ai-to-create-more-trustworthy-data/) reduce potential revenue losses from outages or regulatory violations, supporting business growth.

From my experience, this is especially crucial in highly regulated payment environments where [security and compliance](https://thenewstack.io/want-to-mitigate-risk-invest-in-automation/) are paramount. At Paydock, serving some of the largest financial institutions, we faced the [challenge of securely](https://thenewstack.io/the-challenges-of-securing-the-open-source-supply-chain/) storing sensitive data like card details and merchant credentials while adhering to PCI DSS compliance.

To address this, the platform team developed a unified, secure storage solution that allowed all teams to store sensitive data with ease. The service provided a simple API, handling the complexities of compliance internally and offering an out-of-the-box solution for any credentials. This streamlined approach reduced [risk and enabled teams to focus on delivering secure](https://thenewstack.io/is-community-backed-open-source-software-worth-the-risk/) features faster, with confidence that compliance and security were built into the foundation.

To truly gauge the impact of platform teams, it’s essential to look beyond traditional metrics and consider the broader changes they bring to an organization. One practical exercise for assessing this impact is reflecting on the changes observed over the past six months to a year.

For example, at my previous company, Jooble, where I was a Platform Lead, we noticed that implementing platform teams allowed us to release features more quickly and launch more experiments. This led to an increased number of successful A/B tests that directly improved our core product metrics.

## Driving Cultural Change and Improving Job Satisfaction

The true measure of impact lies in how the platform team affects product outcomes and whether people recognize this impact. In my experience, when we started building solutions that engineers and stakeholders truly wanted, they often expressed their gratitude directly.

I observed this in our platform Slack channel where we improved the release process, and engineers spontaneously posted thank-you messages that received reactions from other team members. Stakeholders also approached us to express their appreciation.

## Enhancing Business Outcomes: Standardization, Security, and Compliance

These genuine expressions of gratitude are powerful indicators of the positive impact platform teams can have on an organization. They reflect not just technical improvements, but also enhanced job satisfaction, better collaboration, and a sense of shared purpose across the organization. The impact of platform teams goes beyond quantifiable metrics — it transforms the way teams work together, innovate, and deliver value to customers.

## Key Factors for a Thriving Platform Team

While measuring the impact of platform teams is crucial, it’s equally important to focus on the happiness and well-being of the platform team members themselves. Through my experience, I’ve identified five key points that significantly contribute to a thriving platform team:

**Passion for problem-solving:** Identify engineers who are excited about creating solutions for other engineers. For example, I once worked with an engineer who was passionate about new tooling trends and introduced Flux CD to our platform. Flux CD, a GitOps tool, streamlined our Kubernetes deployments by automating and ensuring consistency across environments.

It integrated seamlessly with Git, allowing us to track changes, roll back if necessary, and maintain full visibility. These [engineers are invaluable as they drive innovation](https://thenewstack.io/platform-owners-must-master-platform-optimization-to-drive-innovation/) and enthusiasm within the team.

**Commitment to the roadmap:** Ensure team members understand and see the value in platform goals by clearly communicating the “why” behind each initiative and how it contributes to the overall vision. When engineers recognize the importance of their work, they stay more engaged and are motivated to bring forward ideas to help achieve the goals.

For instance, one engineer I worked with proposed a solution to optimize build time by implementing a caching mechanism and reducing image sizes, resulting in a 250% increase in speed. This proactive approach demonstrated how a shared understanding of goals can inspire valuable contributions that drive results.

**Empowerment and resources:** Provide the necessary tools, budget, and authority for the team to excel. This means investing in development tools, allocating training budgets, and giving the team the autonomy to shape the platform’s architecture.

For example, one engineer proposed using Grafana’s On Call solution to simplify incident management. He engaged with engineers to gather feedback, created a proof of concept, and demonstrated the potential impact. This initiative improved incident response and showcased the value of empowering [engineers to drive solutions that enhance the development experience](https://thenewstack.io/api-governance-and-developer-experience-in-a-developer-portal/).

**Fostering collaboration:** Encourage communication and cross-functional teamwork by pairing engineers with complementary strengths. In my experience, pairing an innovation-driven engineer with one who had strong product knowledge led to the creation of a robust solution using GitLab CI.

Together, they designed automated pipelines that streamlined releases, including key steps like incremental traffic switching, ensuring smoother rollouts. This collaboration resulted in a more efficient and reliable release process.

**Psychological safety:** Create an environment where team members feel safe expressing ideas, experimenting, and even failing. This involves actively encouraging diverse viewpoints, celebrating both successes and learnings from failures, and ensuring that all team members feel their contributions are valued.

As a leader, I lead by example — being vulnerable, sharing my own failures, and showing appreciation. I know team members may not always listen to what I say, but they’ll follow my actions. I recognize every contribution, no matter how small, and make it a habit to say thank you, even when things are busy. This approach has helped me foster a culture of trust and collaboration.

## Listening for Impact: The Role of Empathetic Leadership

The foundation of understanding and improving these aspects lies in one critical skill: listening. As my professional coaching training taught me, truly listening — not just hearing — is crucial. It’s about understanding everyone’s perspective and connecting intuitively to the real message, including what’s not being said.

This level of listening, often referred to as “Level 3” or intuitive listening, involves paying attention to all sensory components: The speaker’s tone of voice, energy level, feelings, and even the silences between words. By practicing this deep, empathetic listening, leaders can create a profound connection with their team members, uncovering motivations, concerns, and ideas that might otherwise remain hidden.

This approach not only enhances team happiness but also unlocks the full potential of the platform team, leading to more innovative solutions and stronger collaboration.
