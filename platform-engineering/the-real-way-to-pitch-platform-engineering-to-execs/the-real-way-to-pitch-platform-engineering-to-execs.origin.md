Getting C-suite executives to give the green light for your company’s nascent [platform engineering](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/) initiative may not happen the way you think it will.

It is sensible to think that pointing out that platform engineering will help your company’s developers by making them happier, more productive and giving them the best tools to generate better and more secure code will be great selling points for your executives.

But that may not be the winning formula for success. Instead, find out exactly what factors your company’s executives hold dear in making such decisions and build your case around those to target their strong support for driving onto the entrance ramp for platform engineering.

That is the advice from [Luca Galante](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-galante/), a core contributor to the global developer’s community [PlatformEngineering.org](https://platformengineering.org/), and an ardent luminary of platform engineering in the world of software development.

“What executives care about is not developer experience,” Galante told The New Stack.

But what they do care about are things that haunt all executives, he said, including how things will affect their top lines, their bottom lines, their time to market, employee retention and [application security](https://thenewstack.io/improving-application-security-requires-defining-better-metrics/).

“Of course, you will not find a CTO that says, ‘I do not care about developer experience,’” said Galante. “But the reality is, they do not.”

What executives want to see are glowing results.

Complicating that, not all executives will care about the same thing at the same time in every situation, said Galante, who also is the vice president of product and growth for platform engineering vendor, [Humanitec](https://thenewstack.io/humanitec-the-golden-path-to-platform-engineering/). “Maybe one or two reasons to move to platform engineering are really pressing. Maybe their boards of directors asked them to do something because their time to market is too slow or sucks. Or maybe there are one or two initiatives that they care about, or they saw their quarterly budgets slashed, right?”

## For Success, Address Those Executive Concerns
“The trick there is to attach the platform engineering initiative to whatever those executive focuses are,” said Galante. “You need to find out what is it that they care about — if it is cost or whatever, then you need to spin the story on those focuses.”

[Kaspar von Grunberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kvgruenberg/), the CEO of Humanitec, agrees that this is where these discussions need to start.
“It is not what you think,” von Grunberg told The New Stack. “It is not with the developers, almost never. It is in most cases with the executive team or the middle management of the infrastructure and operations organization who are looking at the current situation and saying, ‘We are too slow, we cost too much, and we are not innovative enough.’ They want to bring time to market down. They want to bring costs down. They want to bring innovation up.”

And interestingly, those executives in most cases will not be newbies when it comes to those first internal discussions about platform engineering, von Grunberg added. “They may say, ‘You know what? Platform engineering could be a great idea for us,’” he said. “They signal to middle management to look at this and then they are starting a platform engineering initiative.”

So, how did the executives even know about platform engineering and what it means for their companies? Through attendance at tech conferences? By reading research reports? By talking to industry peers?

“I think you are underestimating our scale,” said von Grunberg. “We have a very high reach as a technology in our databases, on social media and on PlatformEngineering.org. Gartner has labeled platform engineering with one of its online hype cycles. So, at this point it is well known and growing” among enterprise IT executives, he said.

But getting those executives to buy in and spend money to adopt platform engineering is all about the right messaging, said von Grunberg.

“It is using a story like [bringing in] standardization and efficiency,” he said. “It is a story that resonates with executives forever, and ‘boom,’ then that train is running. Usually, it is not the top management that comes in with the decisions, but it is someone like the vice president of infrastructure and operations who comes in, and then a delicate journey starts.”

Then, when you get the funding and start the early stages of the project, it is critically important to start small, explained von Grunberg. “This is the most important thing — do not overestimate yourself. And go slowly. It takes a lot of time to build a good platform, because you are building a product. Products take time. Do not promise too much. Go step by step.”

## Not a ‘Once and Done Three-Month Project’
Now that the executives are on board and the project funding is lined up, it is time to get to work, said Galante. But executives must be kept informed from the outset that this platform engineering initiative “is not a once and done three-month project,” he said. “That is how you fail as a platform engineer.”

Instead, it is important to ensure that the executives know that the project will take six, 12 or 18 months to deliver the huge economies of scale that platform engineering will provide, he said. “It is very important that as a team you attach this long-term objective to this long-term vision of your platform.”

## To Gain Executive Buy-in, Highlight KPIs, Increased Speed and Heightened Agility: Analyst
[Paul Nashawaty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulnashawaty/), principal analyst for AppDev with theCUBE Research, told The New Stack that his best advice for getting your platform engineering plans approved is to align business [key performance indicators (KPIs)](https://thenewstack.io/measuring-key-kpis-and-platform-engineering-success/) with the delivery of code.
Those in charge of designing and pitching the platform engineering plans must point out the inherent benefits that will be gained, including accelerated time to value, the delivery of better code, faster aligning to the overall business objectives, reduced complexity, automation and rebalancing resources to address skills gap challenges, said Nashawaty.

“One of the key aspects of this transformation is quantifying the ROI with tangible data,” he said. “It is crucial to provide a clear illustration of the financial impact that adopting platform engineering can bring. For instance, organizations can significantly lower their infrastructure costs through strategic automation and optimized resource utilization.”

It is also worth pointing out that automation driven by platform engineering can lead to operational expense reductions in the range of 15% to 25%, according to industry benchmarks, said Nashawaty. “This substantial cost-saving potential can be a driving factor as organizations consider the value of implementing such systems.”

Also to be pointed out as a benefit of platform engineering are talent attraction and retention, which are critical in today’s competitive job market, Nashawaty said.

“Developers and engineers are increasingly seeking work environments that offer modern, efficient tooling and the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies,” he said. “By embracing platform engineering, a company can position itself as a tech-forward organization, which in turn helps to attract top engineering talent and retain existing staff. A culture that prioritizes innovation and upgrades its tooling will foster job satisfaction and loyalty among employees, ultimately contributing to the organization’s overall success.”

But for the executives, even more compelling for them will be the argument that the introduction and nurturing of platform engineering will deliver reliable and critical future systems and business scalability, said Nashawaty. “[Discuss how a strong platform foundation allows for smoother scaling as the business grows](https://thenewstack.io/the-birth-and-continuing-evolution-of-platform-engineering/), enabling faster adoption of new technologies without overhauling infrastructure,” he said.

“Organizations are moving closer to platform engineering to overcome some of the code quality issues they have been seeing,” said Nashawaty. A trend report he ran in 2022 found that only 29% of the respondents were doing [continuous integration (CI)](https://thenewstack.io/continuous-integration-is-just-a-script-runner/) testing on their code, but that by 2024 it increased to 66%, which meant that the quality of apps being pushed through the [CI/CD](https://thenewstack.io/ci-cd/) pipeline and overall software development life cycle were getting better.

“Overall, the data is showing improvements in the release cycles by engaging platform engineers to help address the skill gaps and complexity,” Nashawaty said.
