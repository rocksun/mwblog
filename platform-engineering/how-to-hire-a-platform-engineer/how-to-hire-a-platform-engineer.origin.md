LONDON — Many organizations are still just embarking on their [platform engineering](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/) journey.

That means they are deciding if and how to hire a platform engineer. Unless of course they are just making the popular mistake of [retitling their DevOps engineers](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering-wont-kill-the-devops-star/) in order to pile more work on them.

For [Hazel Weakly,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hazelweakly/) who built the platform engineering and infrastructure team at [Datavant](https://www.datavant.com/), you need to consider what role you are hiring for before you try to find the right person for the job. Because platform engineering includes at least four resilience engineering archetypes, she said during her keynote at [Platform Engineering Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/co-located-events/platform-engineering-day/) as part of [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/).

## What Makes an Ideal Platform Engineer?
These four roles, at smaller companies, begin as one, Weakly said. But as systems scale, the lines between responsibilities start to form.

**Rebound:**the ability for a system to bound back, led by the site reliability engineer.**Robustness:**how a system tolerates disruption, led by the infrastructure engineers.**Graceful extensibility:**how a system stretches to handle surprises and how a team can compact sprawling complexity, led by the platform engineers.**Sustained adaptability:**the basis of developer experience.
These [platform engineering type roles](https://thenewstack.io/what-makes-the-ideal-platform-engineer/) may devolve into different roles, Weakly said, but none can be treated as completely separate; they are intrinsically linked and often united within the internal developer platform.

Besides these skills, she said, there are two essential attributes to a good platform engineer:

- Intellectual humility.
- Ecological awe.
What does she mean by “intellectual humility”? “They’re very, very good at knowing what they know and what they don’t know,” she said. “They’re open to new ideas. They’re not stuck at following things. They’re happy to be corrected, and they tend to be able to work very, very cooperatively and collaboratively and to learn together with people.”

Because the role of platform engineer is deeply cross-functional, the ability to work cooperatively and collaboratively is essential.

As for ecological awe, she said, it’s that feeling of “I am so tiny” while standing at the edge of a mountain. Looking at the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/?utm_content=inline+mention) [landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/), for instance, means examining overwhelming complexity and systems thinking and still, she said, thinking, “Wow, this is cool.”

As you build your first platform engineering team, Weakly said, you need generalists who have some experience and understanding of those four archetypes as well as the actual internal developer customer experience. But you also need people who will eventually help you hire more people. In fact, she argued, that may be the most important part of your platform engineer search.

“When you hire people that are not prepared to really become leaders in the company, then you’re in a really, really tough spot. Because those people build stuff, and they have a lot of opinions,” Weakly said. And then it becomes painful for the business if they are not ready to step up and be leaders: “The first team needs to know they will become leaders and they need to be prepared for that.”

## How to Interview Platform Engineers
Now that you know what you are looking for, how do you make sure you can attract the right people for [your platform team](https://thenewstack.io/how-a-devops-team-became-a-platform-engineering-team/), with the right job interview process?

First, throw away the unnecessarily lengthy, multistep interview process. “Interviews are not hazing rituals,” Weakly said. She thinks there are only four parts that are necessary to evaluate if someone has potential as a platform engineer in your company:

- Let’s learn about each other.
- Let’s solve a technical problem together.
- Let’s solve a sociotechnical problem together.
- Let’s see how you and your future stakeholders and cohort get along.
“Platform engineering doesn’t exist without its users,” she said. “Platform engineering, more than any other discipline in engineering, deeply, deeply relies on collaboration.”

This means you need to not only know that your candidates have technical prowess, but that they can handle the deeply sociotechnical work. The role of a platform engineer needs to build relationships with both their technical stakeholders — their internal developer customers — and their business stakeholders.

This is especially true in the [current climate of tech layoffs](https://thenewstack.io/how-tech-industry-layoffs-are-impacting-developers/). [Platform team members](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-be-an-effective-platform-engineering-team/) will often be last hired, first fired. Platform engineers need to understand how to deliver both technical and business value, collaborating across the organization.

Make sure this is clear from the job description onward. And reflect it in the actual [interview process](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-make-tech-interviews-suck-less/). For starters, Weakly said, cut that whiteboard interview.

“Whiteboard coding is actually worse than useless,” she said. Especially in a platform engineering interview, when you “want to figure out how you solve things together.”

The right interview doesn’t ban the use of AI, Weakly continued, or any sort of googling, often mislabeled as “cheating.” Indeed, most developers rely on all these tools, so you want your candidates to approach the interview “open-book exam style,” so they can walk you through how they approach a problem.

It’s great if AI solves a problem, but more likely it’ll get it wrong — and the ability for an engineer to spot that error and fix it is very useful.

And make sure any technical test is something your current engineers can pass. Getting hung up on “elite” technical hires, she said, are why the industry keeps hiring the same and not solving the same problems.

## Re-Examine Your Hiring Pipeline
Weakly talked extensively on the keynote stage — to a packed room of mostly white men — about the ways the engineering pipeline self-selects out often the most qualified candidates. This is especially true for candidates with the unique skills of the platform engineer.

First and foremost, cut the word “passion” from your job description, which she said is just code for “I want a plucky, strapping young lad,” who won’t speak up after working abusively long hours. You want candidates who care about the craft of software engineering, but passion should not be required for a job. She reminded the audience that a job is a transaction and companies should expect it to be treated as such.

Similarly, Weakly called to the audience to stop hiring [on the basis of side projects](https://thenewstack.io/open-source-needs-younger-maintainers-how-can-it-get-them/), which often translate to, “I make my wife raise the kids.”

When considering an interview, ask yourself: What are the environmental conditions that allow this to happen? In this case, don’t discount the potential privilege that comes with having so much free time for free work.

Expand your talent pool as widely as possible in order to reap the benefits of it, Weakly said. Particularly for platform engineering, where systems thinking — the ability to understand the interconnectedness and interdependencies within people, processes and technology — is so crucial.

“Systems thinking tends to come easier to discriminated demographics,” she said. “Incident response since you were five years old. Deep resource optimization.”

When you expand your hiring pipeline, she said, you’re likely to find people who have been doing “platform engineering” since they were four.

And look for the gardeners, not just the best technical person.

“I would rather hire a gardener any day than most software engineers for platform engineering because gardeners will sit there, and they will tell you why these plants over here affect these plants over there,” Weakly said. “This plant needs to rain because this other thing, and they start describing the whole system of how they balance this entire ecosystem.”

The right platform engineer will be able to examine your sociotechnical system and identify what is good and how to make it great, and who to bring in to do that.

In the end, a platform engineer is a new role. Why not approach it differently than the same old of the tech industry?

“When it comes to looking for that excellence, when it comes to figuring out what the best is, throw away the concept of the best,” Weakly said. “Throw away the concept of hiring for elites. Throw away the hated rituals. Throw away the whiteboard interviews.

“Then figure out these humans. How can they work together? How can they work with us? And how do we work together to build something beautiful?”
