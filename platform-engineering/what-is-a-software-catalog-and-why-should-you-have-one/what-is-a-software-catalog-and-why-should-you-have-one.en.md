As your organization grows, so does the number of tools, services and libraries your teams rely on. New internal services are built, APIs are added and open source dependencies become part of daily development. Over time, the tech stack becomes more complex, making it harder for you to maintain clear visibility of everything in use. You might struggle to locate assets, manage outdated services or avoid duplicating work.

Without proper [documentation](https://thenewstack.io/best-practices-for-creating-markdown-documentation-for-your-apps/), understanding ownership and dependencies, or determining the impact of changes becomes a slow and frustrating process.

This lack of visibility can lead to unnecessary costs and inefficiencies. For instance, a 2024 report by [Flexera](https://info.flexera.com/CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud) found that public cloud spending exceeded budgets by 15% on average, partly due to poor software tracking. Similarly, a 2023 [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/peer-community/oneminuteinsights/omi-keeping-cloud-costs-check-it-leader-perspectives-rfz) survey showed that 69% of IT leaders experienced budget overruns for the same reason.

A [software catalog](https://docs.mia-platform.eu/docs/software-catalog/overview) can help you solve these challenges. It serves as a centralized system for tracking and managing all your software, services and dependencies, providing much-needed clarity and control.

Let’s discover what a [software catalog is](https://thenewstack.io/the-hidden-costs-of-multiple-service-catalogs-in-development/), its key components and the benefits it offers, such as improving visibility, reducing duplication and [optimizing costs](https://thenewstack.io/ai-code-generations-unexpected-costs-for-dev-teams/).

## What Is a Software Catalog?

A software catalog is a centralized system that helps you track and manage all the software, services and components within your organization. It links each piece of software to its metadata, including ownership, deployment details, dependencies and usage.

## Main Challenges That a Software Catalog Tries to Address

Without a structured system, locating critical information about software assets can be difficult.

Imagine a developer working on a payment-processing API. Think about these scenarios:

* They may want to reuse that specific component to create something new.
* The payment service is linked to a system that is managed by the developer himself.
* The developer is being onboarded and needs to understand the way things work.

The developer may need to identify where the code is stored, who is responsible for maintaining it and how it integrates with other services. Security teams assessing vulnerabilities need to know which applications are affected and which teams need to be notified. A software catalog provides this visibility, making it easier to track dependencies, manage changes and maintain an up-to-date view of all software assets.

Overall, the use of a software catalog helps address these challenges:

* **No visibility**: It is very hard to find software assets and monitor their status. This lack of visibility leads to inevitable confusion and inconsistencies when it comes to building or reusing components.
* **Duplicated services and efforts**: When you don’t have a clear overview of available services and tools, duplication is around the corner, which means also doubling the efforts and increasing the maintenance costs.
* **Knowledge gathering and sharing**: Without a structured tool to easily access the documentation and all the software assets, it gets complicated to grasp how the ecosystem functions and transfer this knowledge base.
* **Accountability**: It can take longer to resolve issues when you don’t establish precise ownership and who is responsible for software maintenance.

Some organizations try to address these challenges by using [resource catalogs](https://mia-platform.eu/blog/resource-catalog/) or [internal developer portals](https://thenewstack.io/internal-developer-portal-vs-platform-whats-the-difference/) alone. A resource catalog is like a store shelf with ready-to-use components to speed up development workflows, but governance is not its main focus. Internal developer portals are interfaces to provide developers with access to all these tools and resources and interact with them, but portals are not necessarily designed to maintain a structured inventory of software components. These approaches help to some extent but do not solve the problem entirely.

## Key Components of a Software Catalog

A software catalog is more than a simple list of services; it’s a comprehensive, centralized solution that helps you manage your software assets without losing track of ownership, dependencies or updates. Typically, a software catalog consists of:

* **Items**: All the resources such as templates, plugins, microservices, APIs, repositories and other ready-to-use components to be used and reused within a project.
* **Data models**: The core purpose of a software catalog is to fetch, organize and match data and metadata about software components and services and their ownership, as well as other entities like platform resources.

## Major Capabilities of a Software Catalog

Beyond the nature and the basic components of a software catalog, here’s a quick look at some of the best features that make a catalog really valuable:

* **Search and discovery —** Finding software resources should be straightforward. A catalog provides a search function that allows teams to locate every asset. This enhances discoverability and reduces redundant work, as developers can quickly check if a solution already exists before creating a new one. Moreover, a software catalog can link managed components with their relevant documentation, making it easier for users to understand and use those components. Most importantly, resources can be highlighted from the catalog and made available for everyone within the platform team just like a blueprint.

* **Ownership and metadata tracking —** When something breaks or needs an update, the first question is: Who owns this? Without a clear answer, teams can waste hours searching for the right person. A software catalog answers that question by assigning ownership to each service, API and data pipeline. It also tracks vital metadata like version history, deployment status and dependencies. This context helps your teams resolve issues faster without checking multiple systems.

* **Integration with CI/CD pipelines —** Software is constantly evolving, and a catalog that does not reflect changes in real time becomes unreliable. Integration with CI/CD pipelines allows the catalog to track deployments, build history and pull request status. This helps teams monitor changes, detect outdated services and handle updates without relying on manual reporting.

* **Mapping dependencies and related resources —** Most software doesn’t exist in isolation. It interacts with other services, APIs or databases, so changes to one system can trigger unexpected failures elsewhere. A software catalog maps these dependencies in a structured way, so your teams can easily assess the potential impact of updates or changes. It reduces the risk of breaking changes and ensures a smoother integration process across systems.

* **Version control and life cycle management —** Software goes through different stages, from development to production and eventually to deprecation. A catalog tracks these stages, helping teams plan migrations, maintain compatibility and prevent reliance on unsupported services. Having a clear view of software life cycles also helps organizations manage technical debt.

A software catalog is only as useful as the features it provides. Ownership tracking, CI/CD integration, dependency mapping and access control create a structured way to manage software assets. But how do these components translate into benefits?

## Benefits of a Software Catalog

A software catalog isn’t just a tool for tracking services; it’s a system that transforms the way your organization manages its software ecosystem, cutting down on unnecessary costs, boosting productivity and ensuring long-term stability. Here are the key benefits:

* **Developer happiness** —Without a central catalog, you may unknowingly build the same functionality multiple times. A developer might start working on a new authentication service without realizing that another team has already built one. This leads to wasted effort and resources and unnecessary complexity.

* **Engineering productivity** — Time spent searching for information slows down development. A catalog provides a structured way to find ownership details, documentation and dependencies without asking around. New engineers can onboard faster by accessing a single system that gives them a full view of the company’s software landscape. Instead of relying on outdated spreadsheets or tribal knowledge, teams can quickly locate the right services to get their work done.

* **Governance and standardization** — Consistency is key when scaling an organization. A software catalog helps standardize metadata, ownership structures and software life cycle stages. It ensures that all services align with best practices, making it easier to monitor usage, phase out outdated services and grant production readiness. Role-based access control (RBAC) limits who can make changes, keeping the catalog accurate and preventing unauthorized updates.

A catalog also enables better incident response. During an outage, finding the right service owner is critical. A catalog allows teams to look up a service, see its dependencies, and contact the right person without delay. Instead of scrambling to figure out who owns a failing API, engineers can use the catalog to pull up the latest version details, related logs and recent changes. This reduces response time and helps teams resolve issues faster.

* **Security and compliance** — When security teams need to assess vulnerabilities or outdated dependencies, they need accurate, up-to-date data fast. A software catalog allows teams to identify affected services and their owners quickly. It helps monitor security policies, flag deprecated services, and track compliance, reducing the risk of missing critical gaps. If a vulnerability is discovered in a shared library, you’ll be able to assess which services are affected and take action quickly.

* **Cost optimization** — Cloud costs can quickly get out of control when there is no clear visibility into resource usage. A [software catalog can integrate](https://thenewstack.io/integrating-ai-to-make-platform-engineering-intelligent/) with cost-monitoring applications, allowing teams to see which services are using the most resources. By linking cost data to specific microservices, teams can identify where expenses are growing and make informed decisions about optimization or deprecation.

## Software Catalog and AI Implementation

AI models need massive amounts of data and, above all, a solid knowledge base to perform well.

The software catalog serves as a comprehensive book of contextualized sources within your [internal developer platform](https://thenewstack.io/7-core-elements-of-an-internal-developer-platform/ "internal developer platform"), enabling several AI-powered capabilities that enhance the developer experience and the overall platform functionalities.

This translates into a comprehensive context to feed the AI, thus allowing it to return valuable, actionable insights. Metadata about software components and services, platform resources like runtime configurations, semantics, application configurations, and runtime data: All of these represent a cohesive context of the entire platform for the AI.

For instance, AI-native developer platforms with a comprehensive software catalog could feature an [AI companion](https://mia-platform.eu/blog/conversational-devx-expert-insights/) that guides you step by step with tailored assistance or intelligent agents for composition and prototyping. Context-aware agents understand your prompts and suggest bespoke microservices or even architectures. This facilitates the instantiation of services, streamlines the setup and dramatically speeds up the overall [software development life cycle](https://mia-platform.eu/blog/software-development-lifecycle-sdlc-and-ai/).

## Final Thoughts

A software catalog is the foundation for taking control of your growing software ecosystem. It only delivers value when it stays up to date, integrates with daily workflows and becomes a part of the way your team operates.

If you’re thinking about adopting a software catalog, start by defining what needs to be tracked. Focus on key elements like ownership, dependencies and CI/CD pipelines; these should align with your team’s workflow. Integration is crucial: A catalog that doesn’t connect with your existing development processes will quickly be overlooked. It must pull real-time data from CI/CD pipelines, security tools and cloud resources to remain relevant.

More than just improving visibility, a software catalog changes the way you and your team collaborate. Instead of searching through scattered documentation or rebuilding what already exists, you gain a structured system for managing and improving software.

Finally, as AI is being gradually incorporated into developer platforms, the software catalog gains primary value in providing the AI with context, which means the necessary information about one’s own software landscape to power AI capabilities throughout development stages.
