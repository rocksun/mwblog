Unsurprisingly, we find “developers” all the way at the top of the 20 most important topics at the event, with data and security following close behind. This makes sense as almost any session on platform engineering looks at how to enable developers to securely create increasingly intelligent [data-driven apps](https://thenewstack.io/the-rise-of-data-driven-apps-where-we-are-and-whats-next/).
Next come operations, integration and compute as topics that are also crucial in the
[context of platform engineering](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/architecture-and-design-considerations-for-platform-engineering-teams/), reflecting the comprehensive approach required to support the entire [software development lifecycle](https://thenewstack.io/security-testing-must-be-part-of-software-development-life-cycle/). These topics underscore the importance of operational efficiency, seamless integration of tools and services, and the effective management of computing resources.
Together, these topics highlight the multifaceted nature of platform engineering, aiming to streamline development processes, enhance security measures, and leverage data effectively, all while ensuring that operations run smoothly. This focus on developers, data, security, operations, integration, and compute demonstrates the holistic view that platform engineering takes toward improving developer productivity and facilitating the creation of sophisticated, data-driven applications in a secure and efficient manner.
## Platform Engineering at KubeCon: 60 Sessions, 20 Topics and 8 Key Themes
