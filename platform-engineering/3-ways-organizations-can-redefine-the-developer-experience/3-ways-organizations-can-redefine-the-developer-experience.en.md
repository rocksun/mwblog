Organizations are racing to add new service features and capabilities to stay ahead of the competition and deliver an elevated [customer experience](https://thenewstack.io/how-brands-can-use-ai-in-2025-to-close-the-cx-expectation-gap/). But the push for innovation often comes with a human cost.

Developers are under mounting pressure to increase output while under tight deadlines. As stress piles on, developers become worn out and disengaged. In fact, a [recent survey](https://www.harness.io/state-of-developer-experience) of developers found that more than half (52%) cited burnout as a reason their developer peers leave a job.

How can organizations revamp the [developer experience](https://thenewstack.io/improving-developer-experience-drives-profitability/) so they can continue to innovate without sacrificing developer well-being? Here are three ways business leaders can bring meaningful changes to the way their developers operate.

## **1. Implement an Internal Developer Platform**

Fifteen years ago, software delivery was more straightforward. Teams were smaller, there were fewer tools and developers mostly focused on writing code. Today, it’s a different story.

Due to the configuration of modern applications, developers have to manage more microservices, APIs and tools than ever. While these innovations have aided software delivery, allowing teams to build and scale applications quickly, an abundance of services means developers waste time searching for information and context switching between tools.

The result? Cognitive overload slows teams down and pulls their focus away from software development.

One solution for reducing cognitive overload is to implement an [internal developer platform](https://thenewstack.io/the-hidden-benefits-of-internal-developer-platforms/) (IDP) — a centralized location for all tools and documentation. With everything in one place, developers gain access to a self-service toolbox that relieves the burden of shifting between different platforms for individual steps of the development workflow. Instead, they have more time to focus on tasks that directly contribute to the success of the business, such as fixing bugs or enhancing security.

An IDP doesn’t just streamline day-to-day work. It also accelerates how quickly new developers can get up to speed. Rather than dealing with a complex set of tools, new joiners can quickly find what they need to begin innovating, meaning organizations can benefit from a more productive developer team from Day 1.

## **2. Build Psychological Safety**

Developers play a crucial role in product development, continuously working to improve performance, security and the user experience. But when a failed deployment or outage inevitably occurs, developers often get the blame.

In organizations where developers operate in fear of punishment or suffer from a damaged reputation over incidents, they’re more likely to remain silent during discussions about contributing factors. When senior engineers are unwilling to speak out, junior members follow suit, and a culture is created where no one [learns from previous incidents](https://thenewstack.io/what-can-incident-teams-learn-from-crisis-management/). As a result, organizations often deal with repeated issues in a high-stress environment.

Building a culture of psychological safety requires a change in the way businesses view incidents. Postmortems need to move away from assigning blame and move toward identifying the contributing factors to an incident. Over time, this change in mindset can help create a blameless culture. When developers know they won’t be punished for unforeseen issues that occur later in the software development cycle, they’re more likely to speak up, share ideas and suggest improvements to existing processes. These types of healthy discussions create a low-stress environment where developers can [identify areas for improvement and refine processes](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-identify-your-wasteful-processes/), reducing the likelihood of repeat incidents occurring.

## **3. Adopt a “Secure by Design” Mentality**

When an incident occurs, developers are on the front lines of remediation. Planned work is dropped and they’re regularly pushed to work extended hours under pressure to get systems back online as quickly as possible. But with developers spending more than [57%](https://developer.cisco.com/articles/from-frustration-to-innovation/from-frustration-to-innovation/#from-frustration-to-innovation-how-full-stack-observability-can-help-developers-escape-war-rooms-and-maximize-impact) of their time on reactive work, such as being dragged into “war rooms,” there’s little space left for higher-value tasks such as feature development or software updates. Not to mention the stress and resulting burnout caused by continuous and lengthy manual incident resolution.

To eliminate the constant firefighting, organizations need to embrace a “secure by design” approach. Prioritizing testing and code review from the start ensures developers avoid the pressure of cutting corners to meet tight software development and delivery deadlines. A proactive approach to development ensures that teams are patching as many vulnerabilities as possible, including insecure API endpoints and configurations, before code can escalate into a larger issue in production. In turn, developers work in a more stable environment and spend less time responding to incidents like downtime and performance-related issues.

Automation can take this even further. Instead of spending time waiting for manual reviews, automated unit testing and regression testing enable developers to launch multiple tests at once and run them in batches. The time between testing and feedback is reduced, enabling developers to identify and resolve issues faster to streamline the software delivery pipeline.

## The Bottom Line

When developers feel supported, they deliver higher-quality work and tap into their creative potential to drive innovation across the entire business. The result is clear: Organizations that invest in the developer experience deliver cutting-edge products and services that fuel business growth.
