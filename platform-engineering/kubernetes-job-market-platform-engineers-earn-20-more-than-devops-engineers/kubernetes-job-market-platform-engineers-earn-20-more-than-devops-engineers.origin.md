In the rapidly evolving tech landscape, the roles of [Platform Engineers](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/) and [DevOps Engineers](https://thenewstack.io/devops/) have garnered significant attention. Though both positions play crucial roles in software development and operations, [recent trends](https://thenewstack.io/how-a-devops-team-became-a-platform-engineering-team/) suggest that Platform Engineer jobs may offer particular advantages over their DevOps counterparts.

What are these advantages? And why should you consider a Platform engineer role instead of a DevOps? Letâ€™s find out.

We will use the [Kube Careers State of the Kubernetes job market report Q3 2024](https://kube.careers/state-of-kubernetes-jobs-2024-q3) for this analysis, as it has one of the most significant job datasets in the Kubernetes domain.

Please note that [Kube Careers](https://kube.careers/) only lists jobs that require [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/) experience and are not listed by recruitment agencies.

## The Dataset
For Q3 2024, Kube Careers scrapped through **8772** jobs, filtering these down to a dataset of **1607** jobs in total.

Of these, Software Engineer positions were the most popular, followed by DevOps and Platform Engineer roles. Of the total jobs published,

- 41% (666) of these were Software Engineer positions.
- 11% (190) were DevOps Engineer roles.
- 9% (139) of these were Platform Engineer roles.
## DevOps vs. Platform Engineers
For Q3 2024,

- On average, the
**minimum**salary for a**DevOps Engineer**was**$112,875**, and the**maximum**was**$168,744**. - The
**minimum**average salary for a**Platform Engineer**was**$138,609**, and the**maximum**was**$198,069**. - If we compare the average salaries for the two positions, we find that:
- The minimum salary is
**higher by 18%**, while the maximum salary is**higher by 14%**for Platform Engineers compared to DevOps.
If we compare the data for the past five quarters, Q3 2023 to Q3 2024, we find that:

- On average,
**Platform Engineer salaries have been a staggering 21% higher than DevOps Engineer salaries.** - The highest difference was, in fact, in
**Q3 2023**, where the**Platform Engineer salaries were 26% higher**than their DevOps counterparts.
## Platform Engineer Positions Pay More and are More Remote-Friendly
In Q3 2024, **40%** of the DevOps jobs required **In-office presence**, **32%** allowed **remote work**, and **28%** preferred a **Hybrid working model**.

During the same quarter, **49%** of the Platform Engineer jobs offered **remote working**, **28%** were **Hybrid jobs**, and **23%** were strictly **In-Office jobs**.

Thus, Platform Engineer jobs were 17% more remote-friendly than DevOps jobs.

Q3 2024 was an exception, after all.

If we look at the data for the past five quarters, we can see that **DevOps** **Engineer positions have historically been more remote-friendly**, bu**t the tables have turned in Q3 2024**.

If we average the remote working preference for the past five quarters, **DevOps Engineer** positions average** 47%**, while **Platform Engineer** positions average **45%**.

## Platform Engineer Positions, Though, Have Always Been More Hybrid-Friendly
It gets interesting if we take the data for the past five quarters based on the hybrid working mode.

The findings are:

- The preference for hybrid working in
**DevOps and Platform Engineer jobs**has risen over the quarters. - Platform Engineer positions have always been
**more hybrid-friendly**than DevOps positions. - If we take the average of the past five quarters,
**Hybrid**is the preferred working mode for**21% of the DevOps jobs**and**30% of the Platform Engineer jobs**.
## Conclusion
While both DevOps and Platform Engineer positions have advantages and disadvantages, Platform Engineer positions **pay more, offer at least similar remote work, and are more hybrid-friendly**.
