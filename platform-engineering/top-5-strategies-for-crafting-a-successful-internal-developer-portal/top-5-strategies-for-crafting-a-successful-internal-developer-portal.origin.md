With the rise of platform engineering, internal developer portals have become essential for easing the burden on software developers. According to Gartner, by year-end, 75% of organizations with platform teams are expected to implement self-service developer portals.

Many developer portals are constructed using open source frameworks, with Backstage leading the pack in popularity. But without the right approach, these portals may fail to gain the traction needed to deliver their intended value. Drawing from insights shared by engineering leaders in our community, here are five critical practices to ensure your dev portal thrives.

**1. Prioritize a Self-Service Experience**
The core purpose of a dev portal is to enhance the developer experience by simplifying access to the tools and resources required throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). Self-service is the cornerstone of this mission. Developers should be able to locate what they need effortlessly, whether it’s setting up infrastructure, launching pipelines, adding observability features, or running tests.

To make this happen, create a well-organized catalog of services and documentation and pair actions with templates that developers can deploy in a few clicks. You should prioritize a user-friendly interface and include reference implementations for common use cases. The real magic occurs when discoverability encourages developers to [explore unfamiliar tools or services](https://thenewstack.io/solocon-explore-service-mesh-api-gateways-graphql-ebpf/), sparking innovation and boosting efficiency across their workflows.

One of our customers, for example, adopted Harness IDP to streamline their developer onboarding process, and the impact was immediate. Thanks to pre-built templates and automation, developers could self-serve instead of relying on manual handoffs, reducing the typical onboarding time from 5-10 days to just a few hours.

**2. Leverage Automation to Eliminate Repetitive Work**
A powerful dev portal frees developers from mundane, repetitive tasks by embedding automation into everyday processes. Activities like [launching a staging environment](https://thenewstack.io/orca-security-launches-first-k8s-testing-staging-environment/) or moving code through build, test, and deployment stages should require minimal manual effort.

Tools like Infrastructure as Code (IaC) are vital here, sparing developers from needing deep expertise in [managing today’s complex environments](https://thenewstack.io/managing-kubernetes-complexity-in-multicloud-environments/). To reduce toil, your organization should integrate [IaC to provision environments and provide pre-built CI/CD pipelines](https://thenewstack.io/questions-to-ask-about-the-iac-in-your-ci-cd-pipeline/).

This lets them dedicate more energy to coding and delivering business value. To maintain quality, automate scanning and validation checks with scorecards that [evaluate code against metrics like performance or security risks](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-assess-integration-security-risks-when-evaluating-saas-vendors/), offering developers guardrails to deploy confidently without fear of disruptions.

With customers, we see that their CI/CD process often involves scattered scripts, multiple tools, and no centralized control. Once migrated to utilizing our dev portal tools, they’re now able to use standardized pipelines and scorecards to catch issues early. This means developers don’t need to rely on DevOps specialists for routine tasks and instead can launch, test and deploy on their own with policy and governance in mind.

**3. Seamlessly Connect the Ecosystem**
Developers often have entrenched preferences for tools and workflows honed over years of practice. Since an IDP aims to improve their experience, your IDP should integrate with the tools they already use rather than forcing a complete overhaul of their toolkit.

Beyond that, development tools frequently interact with broader systems, like IT service management platforms (e.g., ServiceNow), collaboration tools (e.g., Slack), code repositories (e.g., Git), or knowledge bases. For a dev portal to shine, it must integrate smoothly with both third-party and in-house tools, enabling developers to work efficiently in their preferred ways.

To make this integration seamless, your organization should map out your dev toolchain and connect top workflows, use plugins or APIs to bring in external tools, and make common actions, like creating a repo, a single-click task.

Flexibility is key for most of our customers, especially those who run a hybrid model where Harness manages the control plane and delegates [operations](https://thenewstack.io/linux-run-a-single-command-across-multiple-servers-with-ssh/) in another environment (e.g., AWS). This type of setup gives developers security and control over sensitive data, while still allowing for flexible, scalable CI/CD operations — all orchestrated through the internal developer portal. This way, developers stay in the tools they know but benefit from unified visibility.

**4. Establish Strong Governance and Oversight**
Engineering leaders must maintain authority over their dev portals to ensure proper usage and minimize risks. This requires implementing governance policies that uphold best practices and safeguard security across the SDLC.

To maintain governance, your organization should incorporate Identity and Access Management (IAM) to restrict access to capabilities based on roles, ensuring only authorized developers can use specific features. Additionally, define a robust [security policy to protect sensitive data](https://thenewstack.io/llm-integration-pitfalls-protecting-sensitive-data-in-the-ai-age/) and comply with regulations like GDPR, keeping the organization on solid footing.

**5. Simplify With Purpose-Built Solutions**
Alternatively, opting for a ready-made, enterprise-grade platform like Harness can streamline the process. By bypassing the need to build an IDP from scratch, developers can focus solely on writing and running software.

For one of our customers, the decision to partner with us was grounded in strategic alignment. The team was looking for a platform-centric [approach that would unify CI/CD](https://thenewstack.io/ai-generated-code-requires-a-trust-and-verify-approach/), improve governance and enhance the developer experience. Our offerings checked those boxes, enabling the organization to scale standardization while reducing manual effort and onboarding time.
