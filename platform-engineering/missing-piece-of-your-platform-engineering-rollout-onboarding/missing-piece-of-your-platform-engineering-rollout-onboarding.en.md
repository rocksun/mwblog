In my time working with platform teams, I’ve discovered a recurring weakness: the [user onboarding journey](https://thenewstack.io/at-platformcon-for-realtor-com-success-is-driven-by-stories/). Whether an emerging startup with a limited budget or a large enterprise with resources to spare, organizations often overlook the [initial user interaction with their platform](https://thenewstack.io/build-platform-engineering-as-a-product-for-dev-adoption/), which can significantly hinder adoption.

According to the [diffusion of innovations theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations), the 16% user adoption mark represents a critical threshold where an innovation transitions from the early market to the mainstream market. This happens because the initial adoption is driven by innovators and early adopters who are willing to accept imperfect experiences due to curiosity or strategic vision, but broader adoption requires appealing to the early majority with more refined solutions.

The early majority, representing 34% of users, becomes crucial for mainstream success. They demand demonstrated value, proven stability and intuitive usability. This shift in user expectations creates a gap that numerous platform initiatives fail to address. Your initial adopters may overlook flaws or points of friction in your onboarding experience, but mainstream users will not. Here are some key considerations when building your platform onboarding experience.

## **Choose a Distinctive, Enduring Brand Identity**

Your platform’s brand identity represents users’ first touchpoint with your solution. Select something distinctive within your company that’s straightforward to communicate without referencing specific tools or frameworks.

Strong platform brand identities typically:

* **Communicate benefits rather than the underlying infrastructure.** Consider names like “Runway” that highlight the intended value proposition rather than technical terms like “K8sPipeline.”
* **Use clear and memorable terms that capture the platform’s mission.** Will someone grasp and remember it after a single mention? Simple, easy-to-pronounce choices like “Beacon” often outperform complex alternatives like “Syzygy.”

Common naming mistakes:

* **Highlighting the number of versions in the name.** This suggests failed past iterations and questions durability.
* **Choosing a forgettable three-letter combination** that is indistinguishable from other abbreviations.
* **Technology-focused names** indicate a prioritization of systems over user needs.

Initial perceptions are predominantly visual. Outdated or inconsistent interfaces can repel users despite strong underlying functionality. Focus on cohesive branding, thoughtful color palettes and messaging tone. These elements may appear secondary, but they establish the foundation for user interaction.

Target clear, personable communication instead of technical terminology. An accessible voice makes your platform welcoming to a diverse team of members across various departments and skill levels.

## **Streamline Initial Access**

Organizations frequently dedicate months to refining platform capabilities while ignoring the fundamental requirement: A smooth, effortless experience.

I’ve observed this pattern across companies of all sizes and sectors. Typical obstacles include:

* Manual onboarding processes for a platform advertised as self-service. When full automation isn’t feasible, handle human tasks asynchronously as much as possible.
* Lengthy approval workflows or restrictions that prevent immediate testing. One great solution to this is to offer immediate, temporary access to your platform for free for 30 days. This is long enough for someone to decide if your platform helps them and raise the necessary request to gain full access.
* Required training before platform use. Training is valuable, but it should be required shortly after joining the platform rather than being a prerequisite.

## **Establish Comprehensive Support Infrastructure**

Even the best platforms require support, and immediate, responsive support is the most effective way to build trust with users. Your primary objectives during support interactions should be to minimize user frustration and maintain momentum.

Develop a robust support structure using diverse channels:

* Ticketing systems offer tracking and integrate with existing workflows.
* Email correspondence handles complex topics requiring thorough explanation.
* Real-time chat enables immediate problem resolution when users are actively working.
* Documentation hubs provide self-service answers to common questions.

Stay accessible through your users’ preferred communication methods, even if that requires monitoring several platforms. Respond to chat requests within an hour and consistently share solutions publicly, so the entire community benefits from the resolutions.

## **The Blueprint for Platform Success**

The foundation of platform engineering excellence isn’t selecting optimal technologies. It’s rooted in empathy and understanding. The most successful platform teams are the ones that nurture a deep understanding of the daily realities of developers, security professionals and operations specialists. They recognize the constraints these teams navigate, their success measurements and the obstacles that cause the most friction.

Companies that emphasize user experience from launch gain significant advantages in adoption rates and user engagement. By developing smooth onboarding workflows, comprehensive documentation and reliable support channels, you can convert the user experience from a challenging one to a delightful one.

Keep in mind that platform users face a significant choice: whether your solution merits their attention and trust. A carefully designed onboarding experience demonstrates respect for that commitment and substantially improves your potential for organization-wide acceptance.
