[Platform engineering teams](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/) create self-service capabilities that provide development teams with golden paths for building reliable and secure software. When done right, these internal platforms manage the complex technical work — monitoring, security controls, CI/CD pipelines and cloud resources — so developers can focus on what matters most: writing code that delivers business value.
Yet, many leaders overlook a critical nuance: A platform team’s success isn’t measured by the sophistication of its technology stack or its feature count. Success is measured by how effectively it [enables other teams to deliver business value faster](https://thenewstack.io/whats-the-future-of-platform-engineering/). Platform teams thrive on collaboration with the teams they serve.

**Where Platform Engineering Efforts Fall Flat**
Many platform engineering initiatives fail, not because of poor technology choices, but because they miss the most critical component: genuine collaboration. The most powerful [internal developer platforms](https://thenewstack.io/do-you-need-an-internal-developer-platform/) aren’t just technology stacks; they’re relationship accelerators that fundamentally transform the way teams work together.

Effective platform teams have a deep understanding of what a day in the life of a developer, security engineer or operations specialist looks like. They know the pressures these teams face, their performance metrics and the challenges that frustrate them most.

Across industries, the pattern is unmistakable: When platform teams create self-service capabilities that feel effortless while reducing developer cognitive load, everyone wins. Businesses deliver faster, developers stay focused on high-impact work and customers receive better products.

Let’s explore the three key considerations for leaders [building strong platform teams](https://thenewstack.io/high-performing-devops-teams-build-self-service-platforms/).

**1. Prioritize Based on Outcomes**
Effective [platform teams align their priorities with the outcomes developers need](https://thenewstack.io/platform-teams-adopt-these-7-developer-productivity-drivers/) to achieve. However, this alignment is easier said than done, especially when platform teams report through IT functions, while development teams report through business units.

To break this organizational misalignment, platform teams must prioritize what developers truly need. The relevant metrics are not traditional technical outputs, but outcomes. Here are a few of the outcomes you should be measuring:

**Increasing adoption rates**: Teams select your platform because it makes their lives easier.**Developer velocity**: Teams using your platform ship faster than those who don’t.**Developer satisfaction**: Regular feedback shows developers enjoy using your platform.**Reduced support burden**: Support tickets decrease dramatically as developers can self-serve through well-designed interfaces and comprehensive documentation.
Great platform leaders educate their leadership teams on the direct connection between developer productivity and business outcomes. Developer experience is no longer a nice-to-have, but a strategic imperative.

**2. Develop a Strong Communication Framework **
Developers who feel heard and respected transform into valuable collaborators, not just users. They contribute insights that improve your platform because they know their needs will shape its evolution. The best platform teams use multiple channels to gain honest feedback, including user research sessions, developer experience surveys and office hours.

Even the name of the platform matters. Teams with names like “Developer Enablement Platform” or “Developer Experience Team” send a clear signal about their purpose: They exist to serve developers, not to control them.

Remember, the platform is a product, and developers are the customers. This mindset shift changes everything.

**3. Create Delightful Developer Experiences**
The core mission of platform teams is to [enable faster software delivery](https://thenewstack.io/software-delivery-enablement-not-developer-productivity/) by eliminating complexity and cognitive load. Put simply: Make the right way the easiest way.

Developer experience extends beyond function; it’s about creating delight and demonstrating that the platform team cares about the human experience, not just technical capabilities. The best platforms craft natural, intuitive interfaces that anticipate questions and incorporate error messages that guide, rather than confuse.

Platform engineering excellence comes from making complex things appear simple. It’s not about building the most sophisticated system; it’s about reducing complexity so developers can focus on creating business value.

**The Path Forward**
The true impact of platform engineering emerges when you combine function and efficiency with a relentless focus on the developer experience. My advice for platform leaders:

**Measure what matters**: Track adoption rates and developer velocity.**Cultivate customer champions**: Identify and involve key users to shape every feature.**Make the right way the easy way**: Success comes when developers choose your platform because it’s genuinely better than alternatives.
The most successful organizations recognize that platforms are collaborative ecosystems that rely equally on human and technical factors. By focusing on outcomes, communication and experience, platform teams become trusted partners to [software development teams](https://thenewstack.io/building-high-performance-software-development-teams-7-tips/), fundamentally transforming the way organizations build software.
