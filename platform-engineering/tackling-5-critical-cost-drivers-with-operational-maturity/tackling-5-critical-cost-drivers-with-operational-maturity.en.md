IT operations teams perform a business-critical role in modern organizations, as they support the digital experiences on which revenue and customer loyalty depend. But with greater exposure comes heightened expectation.

Although [research reveals that](https://www.pagerduty.com/state-of-digital-ops/) 64% of executives plan to increase IT budgets this year, more than half (55%) say that one of their top priorities is to lower operational costs. Finding these savings can affect talent retention, innovation and long-term business resilience. Tackling it should be a priority.

The good news? With the right combination of technology and best practices, there’s plenty of opportunity to drive efficiency in many organizations. Let’s start by breaking down common factors that significantly increase costs.

## **Common Areas of Operational Inefficiency**

### **1. Manual Processes and Non-Value-Added Work**

According to a recent study, [developers spend nearly 25% of their time](https://www.colabsoftware.com/research/23-of-engineering-time-spent-on-non-value-added-work) on repetitive, routine work that can oftentimes be automated. Manual processes heighten this challenge across detection, triage and incident response, creating inefficiencies that drain productivity and morale while extending resolution times.

### **2. Technical Debt**

Legacy systems and shortcuts create fragile infrastructure prone to service outages and brand reputation damage. Technical debt also makes future upgrades more expensive and time-consuming while limiting organizational agility.

### **3. Talent Retention Challenges**

[Technical debt frustrates nearly two-thirds (62%) of developers](https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/01/01/developers-want-more-more-more-the-2024-results-from-stack-overflow-s-annual-developer-survey/), leading to higher turnover, increased recruitment costs and additional pressure on remaining team members. Poor tooling and repetitive work further erode team morale and competitive advantage.

### **4. Missed Innovation Opportunities**

Time spent on maintenance and firefighting reduces capacity for strategic initiatives. Less robust and non-scalable infrastructure also slows the adoption of new technologies and processes, creating costly long-term competitive disadvantages.

### **5. Fragmented Tooling and Data Silos**

Disparate monitoring, alerting and management tools create visibility gaps, duplicate efforts and slow decision-making. Teams waste time correlating information across systems instead of focusing on resolution and proactive improvement.

## **How Operational Maturity Can Tackle Inefficiency**

To drive the improvements needed to tackle these cost pressures, organizations must first understand how [mature their operations](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-improve-operational-maturity-in-an-economic-downturn/) really are.

Operational maturity measures the consistency, reliability and resiliency of a company’s digital operations. This includes its IT infrastructure, workflows, processes and cross-functional alignment between business and technical teams. Mature [operations mean smarter processes](https://thenewstack.io/smarter-ai-for-critical-operations-why-data-matters/) , greater resilience and more efficient resource utilization. There are five stages in the [Digital Operational Maturity Model](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/digital-transformation/ebook/digital-ops-maturity/):

1. ****Manual:**** Organizations lack [automation and process standards](https://thenewstack.io/five-ways-process-automation-can-streamline-itops/), forcing incident responders into war rooms and constant on-call rotations. Teams can spend an average of [up to $700,000](https://www.pagerduty.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Whitepaper_Automation-survey.pdf) on manual incident resolution tasks.
2. **Reactive**: Basic automation and alert visibility provide modest speed improvements, but teams remain overwhelmed by alert volume, trapped in perpetual firefighting mode with little capacity for innovation.
3. **Responsive**: AI and automation accelerate root cause analysis, improving mean time to acknowledge (MTTA) and mean time to resolve (MTTR) metrics. However, siloed tools and processes still create significant friction.
4. **Proactive**: Automated triage and remediation for common issues free up engineers to work on more complex tasks. Teams may even prevent customer-facing issues, but coordination gaps persist.
5. **Preventative**: AI-driven decision-making and fully orchestrated automation prevent recurring issues while continuously monitoring system health. This drives cost savings and competitive advantage through reduced downtime, higher customer loyalty and lower employee churn.

## **Accelerating Operational Maturity Progression**

Moving up the curve requires improved observability, enhanced team coordination and intelligent [automation to eliminate manual work](https://thenewstack.io/move-away-from-manual-with-automated-incident-response/). In practice, this means:

* **Establish repeatable processes** with documented triage and escalation steps accessible to all [team members during incidents](https://thenewstack.io/what-can-incident-teams-learn-from-crisis-management/).
* **Formalize those processes through an intelligent platform** that routes alerts to the right people, triggers and generates smart incident playbooks and enables coordinated cross-team responses.
* **Deploy machine learning** for event correlation and noise reduction, ensuring responders focus only on critical issues.
* **Automate diagnostics and remediation**, while improving visibility on service health and dependencies to accelerate resolution.
* **Implement AI agents** in low-risk, high-impact tasks to resolve issues autonomously before they require human intervention or affect a customer.
* **Treat [incidents as learning opportunities](https://thenewstack.io/3-strategies-to-turn-incidents-into-learning-opportunities/)** for continuous improvement and prevent recurring issues.

## **Don’t Let Inefficiencies Lead to Despair**

Operational inefficiency has many sources. Whether it comes from organizational growth outpacing processes, inherited technical debt or tool sprawl, every organization can systematically progress in the operational maturity curve to transform these challenges into competitive advantages.
