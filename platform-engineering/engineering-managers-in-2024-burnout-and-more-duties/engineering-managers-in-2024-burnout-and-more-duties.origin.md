If you’re a middle or line manager and you’ve taken on more work and are enjoying it less these days, you’ve got a lot of company.
Two reports released this week indicated that a substantial share of engineering managers are taking on increased responsibilities.
Several data points in particular indicate that engineering managers are being spread thin. While 75% of engineers who responded to
[a survey by Jellyfish](https://jellyfish.co/resources/2024-state-of-engineering-management-report/) released Wednesday said their work is rewarding, only approximately 37% of engineering managers reported that they feel the same.
Nearly two of every three participants in the Jellyfish survey — 65% — reported

And 35% of survey participants in a
[new engineering leadership report released by LeadDev](https://leaddev.com/engineering-leadership-report-2024) this week said they are [working longer hours](https://thenewstack.io/is-techs-4-day-work-week-coming/) than they did in 2023.
Among the other findings in the LeadDev report:
- Seventy-one percent of survey participants said they have taken on increased responsibilities at work or have more direct reports and/or teams reporting to them as compared to two years ago.
- Nearly half — 48% — of engineering managers have taken on more direct reports over the past 12 months.
- More experienced engineers who are not officially managers — with titles such as “staff” or “principal”— were most likely (73%) to say they have more responsibilities than last year.
LeadDev’s report drew results from more than 1,100 engineering leaders in March and April. Fifty-three percent of respondents were from Europe (including the U.K.), 32% from the U.S., and the rest from elsewhere.
Jellyfish’s report summarized results from 604 full-time professionals in engineering, including individual contributors, managers, and executives. Nearly half — 46% — of participants work for organizations with at least $50 million in annual recurring revenue. The survey was conducted between February and April by Kickstand Research.
## Hiring and Layoff Picture: It's Complicated
The reasons for the increased burdens on engineering managers cannot be easily blamed on
[tech layoffs](https://thenewstack.io/how-tech-industry-layoffs-are-impacting-developers/), as the two surveys painted contrasting pictures of organizations’ headcounts.
In the LeadDev survey, 44% of respondents said their company has had layoffs in the last two years. However, 29% said they have also seen some hiring increases in that time period.
By comparison, 57% of participants in the Jellyfish survey of engineering leaders said their engineering team has increased in size over the past 12 months, as compared to 14% who reported declines.
Furthermore, 55% expect the headcount of their department to increase over the next 12 months, and 67% saw increased budgets for their engineering organizations this year.
A difference in metrics helps explain the divergence of findings between the two reports. Jellyfish looked at a one-year period and evaluated the net change in total headcount. LeadDev focused on a two-year period of time and didn’t quantify the size of the hiring/firing.
Regardless of individual company hiring plans, fears about job security are real. According to LeadDev, 39% are more concerned about job security than they were last year, while 11% are less concerned.
## Middle Management: Bearing the Burdens
LeadDev also asked about headcount but only focused on people holding manager roles over the last year. Almost as many organizations experienced a net increase (18%) as a decrease (20%) in their managerial ranks. However, digging deeper into the data, we find that the middle management tier appears to have suffered the heaviest losses:
- Among the companies that have had layoffs, 66% say that there has been a net reduction in middle management roles, 64% reported a decline in line management and only a 20% decline in upper management.
- Organizations that saw either a positive or negative change in the number of managerial roles/titles were 67% more likely to have cut middle managers instead of making an increase at that level.
- Larger organizations were more likely to have lost middle managers in the past 12 months. At 1,000-plus employee companies that reported layoffs, 80% reduced middle management, and 72% line management. Only 4% reported reductions in upper management.
