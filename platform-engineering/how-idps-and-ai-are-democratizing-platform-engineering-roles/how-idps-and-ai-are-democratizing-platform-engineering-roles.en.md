Internal developer platforms (IDPs) and the integration of AI are fostering a new era of democratization within software development, helping platform engineering fulfill the quest for a frictionless developer experience and a [streamlined software development life cycle](https://mia-platform.eu/blog/software-development-lifecycle-sdlc-and-ai/) (SDLC).

[Platform engineering](https://thenewstack.io/can-platform-engineering-accelerate-ai-adoption/) uses DevOps and site reliability engineering (SRE) principles to compress the entire SDLC.

Just like a large factory, where both people and small mechanisms play a key role in achieving shared outcomes, platform roles carry out specialized functions and responsibilities to align with business goals.

These roles have traditionally been a prerogative of experienced platform engineers and software engineers because they required deep technical expertise in software development, infrastructure management and specific platform technologies.

Platform engineering facilitated smoother DevOps by creating dedicated cross-functional [platform teams](https://thenewstack.io/streamlining-your-platform-teams-workloads/) that provide shared services as part of an internal developer platform.

IDPs abstract any underlying complexity of infrastructure and tooling, offering self-service capabilities and preconfigured environments. Similarly, AI-powered tools are shattering the wall to entry by automating repetitive tasks, providing intelligent assistance in coding and debugging, and offering insights into system performance.

## Platform Roles: IDPs as Enablers of Democratization

Platform engineering should aid developers by providing them with a solid foundation and essential tools to operate at ease.

However, this is not simple to fulfill, since the cloud native landscape is prone to get layers of complexity, like a ball of threads that gets increasingly tangled.

The result is that platform roles are often unclear without a structured approach.

[Cross-functional platform teams](https://mia-platform.eu/blog/team-topologies-to-structure-a-platform-team/) help untangle this complicated ball of issues with the platform becoming the single version of truth. The IDP is a foundation of knowledge: an intertwined ecosystem that features highly flexible building blocks, reusable components, self-service tools and pre-configured environments.

This abstraction allows roles outside traditional platform engineering, such as data engineers, business analysts and other non-technical contributors, to interact with platform capabilities without needing deep operational expertise or backend knowledge.

By offering standardized, user-friendly interfaces and reusable components, IDPs empower broader teams to provision environments, deploy, monitor and manage applications or data pipelines independently. This reduces reliance on platform engineers for routine tasks and fosters greater autonomy and collaboration across roles.

Namely, the IDP could extend access to:

* **Data engineers**: They can use data [platform capabilities like data catalogs](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-a-software-catalog-and-why-should-you-have-one/), data integration layers and CRUD services. A seamless user-friendly interface enables easier management of data pipelines and tighter integration with software engineering workflows through preconfigured environments for data ingestion and processing.
* **Business technologists and citizen developers**: Power users in departments like marketing, finance or operations have their access to the platform facilitated through features like low-code/no-code enablement, drag-and-drop interfaces and a marketplace of reusable components, allowing them to build business applications and bring value without deep coding knowledge.
* **Business leaders**: Product managers and digital transformation officers have access to dashboards and metrics through self-service tools. They could trigger feature rollouts and view real-time performance data without continuously involving developers.
* **Other IT roles**: The IDP is designed to serve multiple teams, including those in IT operations and application security, by providing self-service discovery and access to capabilities that streamline their workflows. The platform aids them with predefined infrastructure blueprints for provisioning and scaling. For example:
  + **QA/test engineers**: The self-service portal provides automated test environment setup. A QA engineer could deploy a test environment with all the required services with a single click from the platform.
  + **Security analysts**: An IDP dashboard with scorecards and security guardrails enables scanning and compliance checks for new code deployments. The security-as-a-service design is welded directly to the platform.
  + **ML engineers/data scientists**: They could use prebuilt model training pipelines and paved roads to deploy trained models without needing to script infrastructure steps or manage containers.

## AI as Catalyst of the Democratization of Platform Roles

Modern platforms that incorporate AI enhance this process even more. Context-aware virtual assistants and agents streamline workflows, automate processes and recommend bespoke solutions on demand, across all the layers of the IT factory. An already user-friendly interface becomes possibly smarter: It walks you through these layers seamlessly with conversational scope, giving relevant guidance and insights.

This means that all the professionals involved in the crafting and maintenance of software know they can easily access the ecosystem and count on contextualized, valuable sources of information to improve their work and align well with business objectives. But above all, it means everyone plays a role within the platform paradigm.

In a nutshell, AI contributes to the democratization of platform roles by lowering technical barriers and enabling broader participation. Let’s see a few practical examples:

* **Data engineers** receive intelligent suggestions to improve data efficiency or get automatic alerts of data anomalies. AI assistants can also help them discover, manage and speed up data governance processes.
* **Business technicians** benefit from natural language interfaces: Assistants can create automations throughout task workflows and generate scripts, give advice on composing applications or browsing documentation.
* **Business leaders** rely on assistants to summarize deployments’ impact, forecast outcomes, flag risks or to explore system metrics. Augmented analytics support business decision-making.
* **QA/test engineers** can use AI to write tests, identify gaps in test coverage or get suggestions for predictive testing based on recent code changes or historical failure rates.
* **Security analysts** are empowered with curated reports on risk issues and remediation steps, as well as automated alerts based on vulnerabilities and prioritization.
* **ML engineers/data scientists** use AI-powered platforms to automate model deployment, monitoring and data drift detection, but they can also receive hints on feature engineering techniques and golden paths for ModelOps pipelines.

## Broader Implications and Impact on Organizational Roles

The most valuable effect is arguably the shift from traditional platform roles as gatekeepers to enablers and integrators, resulting in:

* **Cross-functional collaboration**: Fostering a culture of cooperation, based on easily accessible data, modules and services within the same platform ecosystem, leads to better alignment with shared business goals.
* **Skill diversification**: [Internal developer platforms](https://thenewstack.io/internal-developer-portal-vs-platform-whats-the-difference/) were designed to abstract complexity. AI further simplifies roles, broadening the scope of what non-technical users can accomplish.
* **Reduced reliance on highly technical teams**: Self-service tools and smart user-friendly interfaces alleviate the burden on platform engineers and highly specialized teams.
* **Operational scalability and agility**: Organizations can scale [DevOps and SRE practices more effectively by distributing platform](https://thenewstack.io/platform-teams-start-small-to-win-big/) responsibilities across a broader user base, reducing bottlenecks and improving agility and operational efficiency.
* **Transparency and accountability**: Having traceable sources of information provides accountability, while security guardrails guarantee that everyone operates within the right boundaries at all organizational levels.
* **Faster decision-making**: IDPs widen the availability of tools and data. AI assistants and augmented analytics dramatically facilitate their consumption. This accelerates responsiveness and agility across departments like marketing, customer service, compliance and operations.
* **Cost efficiency**: The democratization of platform roles reduces dependencies, streamlines workflows and breaks down silos across the organization. Reducing bottlenecks helps keep costs low throughout the SDLC.

## Wrapping Up

With internal developer platforms and AI, platform roles, once accessible only to experienced and specialized figures like [platform and software engineers](https://thenewstack.io/integrating-ai-to-make-platform-engineering-intelligent/), are now open to a range of professionals, such as data engineers and business technologists.

Modern platforms with self-service tools play the leading role in democratizing platform roles by abstracting any underlying complexity. AI companions and agents further magnify platforms’ capabilities by automating and orchestrating processes, by providing tailored recommendations and alerts, and by augmenting user interfaces with intelligent help.

In the end, it’s a win-win situation for everyone, enabling better alignment with business objectives.
