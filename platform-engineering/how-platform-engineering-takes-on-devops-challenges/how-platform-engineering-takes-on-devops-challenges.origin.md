As companies continue to scale at an unprecedented rate, the role of DevOps is undergoing a significant transformation. While DevOps has been instrumental in bridging the gap between development and operations, its limitations and inefficiencies have become increasingly apparent.
Platform engineering is seen by many as the natural evolution of DevOps, addressing its core challenges and enabling organizations to scale more effectively. As the focus moves toward creating self-service platforms and empowering developers, the traditional
[role of DevOps](https://thenewstack.io/devops/) is being redefined.
Let’s review DevOps’ core challenges and
[how platform engineering](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/) may or may not take its place.
## The Current Challenge of DevOps
While DevOps has revolutionized software development and deployment, the increasing complexity of modern
[cloud native technologies](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native/) has placed unprecedented pressure on teams. As organizations scale, the limitations and inefficiencies of current DevOps approaches have become more evident.
One major challenge is the need for more automation in end-to-end DevOps processes.
[Dynatrace’s recent study on DevOps automation](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/devops-automation-were-only-halfway-there/) revealed that only 56% of these processes are automated, leading to slower delivery times and reduced efficiency. The average of nine manual interventions in a typical developer pipeline, including approvals and security checks, further compounds this. These lead to prolonged resolution times and can significantly affect the organization’s bottom line and customer satisfaction.
There are two core reasons for this. The first is toolchain complexity. The DevOps ecosystem’s abundance of tools and technologies can lead to a fragmented environment that’s difficult to manage. This complexity makes it challenging for teams to
[integrate and maintain a cohesive DevOps workflow](https://thenewstack.io/next-gen-devops-integrate-ai-for-enhanced-workflow-automation/), leading to inefficiencies and reduced productivity.
The second is siloed teams. Silos can impede collaboration and communication, which are critical for successful DevOps adoption. Siloed teams often lack visibility into each other’s processes, leading to misalignments, duplicated efforts and slower problem-resolution times.
Even without these issues, teams lack vital skills that drive autonomous operations, making it challenging to implement and maintain DevOps practices effectively. The skills required, including coding, infrastructure management and automation, can be challenging to find and nurture within a single team.
As the limitations of current DevOps approaches become more apparent, organizations are seeking ways to overcome these challenges and improve their software delivery processes. DevOps teams must shorten development cycles to achieve business service-level objectives (SLOs), enhance software quality and innovate faster. Enter platform engineering.
## What Is Platform Engineering?
[Platform engineering](https://www.getambassador.io/kubernetes-learning-center/platform-engineering) is a modern approach to DevOps, a logical extension of DevOps, to be more precise, and designed to work with existing DevOps principles while alleviating the associated cognitive load. Platform engineers streamline standard DevOps activities by building an [internal developer platform](https://thenewstack.io/7-core-elements-of-an-internal-developer-platform/) (IDP) that offers a single application development and deployment toolkit.
A strategic extension of DevOps, platform engineering addresses traditional manual approaches’ shortcomings, drawbacks and constraints. It automates
[development and deployment pipelines](https://thenewstack.io/software-supply-chain-secure-3/), streamlining them for heightened efficiency and effectiveness, surpassing conventional limitations. Adopting a platform engineering culture enables businesses to excel in the digital transformation age by allowing them to prosper in today’s fast-changing technological environment.
Platform teams can simplify and improve the effectiveness of tasks previously handled by DevOps teams. Your platform team must have clearly defined product goals, established DevOps procedures and the right mindset to reach its potential.
In the new tech era, a platform engineer’s role does not replace DevOps but extends the principles that made it successful in meeting new challenges and opportunities.

## Platforms Enable DevOps at Scale
While the advent of DevOps transformed software development considerably, making it more agile and collaborative, organizations often need help handling complexities independently. Platform engineering originated in the need to provide developers with simple, scalable and user-friendly self-service processes to build software faster.
Organizations can take advantage of platform engineering to:
**Simplify processes:**Platform engineering simplifies complex processes by providing a standardized, streamlined software development and deployment approach. **Automate infrastructure and deployment:**Automation is at the core of platform engineering, enabling teams to provision infrastructure and deploy applications with minimal manual intervention. **Provide self-service platforms to enhance developer efficiency:**Self-service platforms empower developers to quickly and easily access the tools and resources they need without relying on other teams or waiting for approvals. **Accelerate time to market:**By streamlining processes and automating tasks, platform engineering helps organizations deliver software faster and more frequently. **Improve scalability and resilience:**Platform engineering enables organizations to build scalable and resilient systems that can handle increased demand and recover quickly from failures. **Foster collaboration:**Platform engineering promotes collaboration by providing a shared platform and a common set of tools and practices that enable teams to work more effectively together.
Platform engineering can help teams quickly scale their current DevOps processes to handle demand without introducing unnecessary overhead. Rather than relying on individual tools, platform engineering builds a cohesive foundation supporting end-to-end delivery.
The key objective of any platform engineering team is to promote tool and configuration reuse. Reusing code makes the application delivery process more efficient, requiring fewer tools and improving code consistency. Instead of writing repetitive code, developers can focus on innovation.
## How Does Platform Engineering Optimize DevOps Efficiency?
The requirements of software development teams often differ. You’ll encounter complexity, bottlenecks and security holes if each development team establishes its own DevOps practices. A platform engineering team may take over part of the DevOps responsibilities such as the following:
**Automate Git workflows:**Platform teams can automate the creation, configuration and management of git repositories, ensuring consistent and secure version-control practices across the organization. **Provision test environments:**By automating the provisioning of test environments, platform teams can reduce the time and effort required for setting up and maintaining testing infrastructure. **Build configuration templates for CI/CD pipelines:**Platform teams can create reusable templates for CI/CD pipelines, enabling development teams to adopt best practices and maintain consistency across projects quickly. **Configure a central repository for secret management and user authentication:**Centralizing these functions helps maintain security and compliance while simplifying access control for development teams. **Configure a repository for application performance monitoring:**Platform teams can set up and maintain a centralized repository for application performance monitoring, which can provide developers with insights into their application’s behavior and performance.
Here is how your platform teams can optimize DevOps efficiency:
**Building a platform for internal developers to work on:**By creating a standardized, self-service platform, platform teams can streamline the development process and reduce the burden on individual teams. **Establishing paved roads to reduce cognitive load:**Paved roads provide predefined, well-tested paths for common development tasks, reducing the cognitive load on developers and minimizing the risk of errors. **Making processes simpler, standardizing them and scaling them up:**Platform teams can identify and streamline complex processes, establish standards and ensure that these processes can scale effectively as the organization grows. **Monitoring key performance indicators**( **KPIs) and metrics:**With this monitoring, platform teams can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to optimize DevOps efficiency. **Improving your team’s performance to deliver greater value to your customers:**Platform teams can continuously assess and enhance the performance of development teams, ultimately leading to better value delivery to customers.
Here are your organization’s key strategies to attract the right engineers to your platform team.
**Establish clear objectives and define realistic timelines:**Clearly communicating the goals and expectations of the platform team and setting achievable timelines helps attract engineers aligned with the organization’s vision. **Embrace diversity and facilitate better communication and collaboration:**Fostering a diverse and inclusive team environment promotes creativity, innovation and practical cooperation between platform engineers. **Provide your platform team with the right tools and technologies:**Equipping the platform team with the necessary tools and technologies enables them to work efficiently and effectively, attracting skilled engineers who value a well-supported work environment.
The future of DevOps lies in embracing platform engineering over traditional siloed practices. Organizations must adopt platform engineering as the next step in the DevOps journey to remain competitive in today’s rapidly changing landscape. It will shape the way teams collaborate, integrate and streamline software delivery in the future.
Platform engineering will foster seamless cross-team communication and optimize workflows as DevOps evolves. Software updates will happen faster through self-service capabilities and automated pipelines, replacing manual tasks.
