With so much emphasis on generating value from developers these days, you would think that tracking [developer productivity](https://thenewstack.io/developer-productivity-in-2025-more-ai-but-mixed-results/) would be a high priority for organizations. Not necessarily, according to data published in [JetBrains’](https://www.jetbrains.com/) [“State of the Developer Ecosystem Report.”](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2024/)

Only 28% of people who participated in the survey and have manager roles said their organizations measure both [developer productivity](https://thenewstack.io/measuring-developer-productivity-whos-winning-the-debate/) and [developer experience](https://thenewstack.io/how-do-you-measure-developer-experience/). Forty percent said they measure neither; 13% weren’t sure if they measured either one.

Among those managers who are aware of their company’s approach to developer productivity/experience, 57% said they are satisfied, as compared to 15% who are dissatisfied.

The report, published in December, surveyed more than 23,000 developers worldwide. Some of the results [have previously been reported](https://thenewstack.io/developers-testing-more-jetbrains-study-finds/) in The New Stack.

## Keeping Up with Trends
Overall, 670 people (4% of the study) described their role to be at least in part that of “developer productivity/developer experience engineer.”

But that doesn’t mean they’re all up to speed on what their organization expects from developer productivity and DevEx. Of the people who said they have responsibility for dev productivity or experience, only 60% said they are aware of their company’s approach toward developer productivity, developer experience and their related processes.

Just as concerning, only 35% of these engineers responsible for developer productivity and/or experience actually follow and stay informed of the latest trends and discussions related to developer experience and developer productivity.
