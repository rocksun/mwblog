*The first of two parts.*
In the fast-paced world of software development, speed and efficiency often define the line between success and stagnation. Enter [platform engineering](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/), a discipline dedicated to building internal developer platforms that enable self-service infrastructure and application services. Let’s explore the role of platform engineering, its principles and the benefits it delivers to organizations striving for scalable, efficient and innovative development practices.

## What Is Platform Engineering?
Platform engineering focuses on designing and operating internal platforms that streamline the development process for internal teams. These [platforms aim to simplify infrastructure management](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering-needs-to-manage-infrastructure-too/), enabling developers to focus on what they do best: coding and innovation.

## Key Roles in Platform Engineering
**Platform architects:**Responsible for strategizing and designing the platform’s structure to meet the organization’s needs that are tied to the innovation driven by developers in multiple lines of business.**Platform engineers:**Responsible for building, maintaining and evolving the platform’s components including implementing a self-service experience for developers, and access to underlying infrastructure and services using a catalog while ensuring reliability and efficiency SLAs required by the modern applications.**Developer experience (DX) engineers:**Prioritize improving the developer journey, making the platform intuitive and efficient.
**Core Principles of Platform Engineering**
**Customer focus:**Success depends on understanding and meeting the needs of internal teams. Feedback loops, transparency and empathy ensure that[platforms align with users’ real-world challenges](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering-overcoming-data-management-challenges/).**Standardization and automation:**
-
- Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for consistency.
- Standardize environments to reduce variability.
- Automate compliance and security reporting for better governance.
- Use abstraction layers to hide complexity while improving usability.
- Embed life-cycle automation to minimize manual intervention.
**3 Key Benefits and Outcomes of Platform Engineering**
**Increased developer productivity:**Developers spend less time on infrastructure concerns, reducing friction during onboarding and enabling them to focus on delivering value.**Improved application quality:**By embedding best practices within the deployment flow, platforms ensure robust, resilient applications.**Operational excellence:**Automation and standardization lead to increased efficiency, reliability and compliance, giving organizations a competitive edge.
## Conclusion
The adoption of platform engineering transforms organizations by enhancing efficiency and developer satisfaction. But building these platforms isn’t without challenges. On February 27, I will host a discussion on the key benefits and core principles of platform engineering with a best-in-class practitioner, James Webb, senior director of engineering at Portworx by Pure Storage. He brings a vast depth of platform engineering expertise from his years at T-Mobile.

In the next installment, I’ll dive into the journey of managing Kubernetes-based developer platforms at scale and the top three lessons Webb learned from his experience at T-Mobile. Stay tuned!
