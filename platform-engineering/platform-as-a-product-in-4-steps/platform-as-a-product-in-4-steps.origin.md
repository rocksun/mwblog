Platform engineering is taking the cloud native world by storm, but there’s still much to learn about building successful platforms. This challenge might feel overwhelming at first, but there’s one powerful approach that makes getting started simpler: the platform as a product approach.
[Platform engineering](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/) is the discipline of designing and building internal developer platforms (IDPs). According to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) [platforms white paper](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platforms/#what-is-a-platform), an IDP is: *“… *a foundation of self-service APIs, tools, services, knowledge, and support … arranged as a compelling internal product. Autonomous delivery [teams can make use of the platform](https://thenewstack.io/tame-the-tiger-a-lighthearted-guide-to-platform-teams/) to deliver product features at a higher pace, with reduced coordination. *”*
To succeed,
[platform teams must build an IDP](https://thenewstack.io/ebooks/platform-engineering/platform-engineering-what-you-need-to-know-now/) that is both effective and compelling. Effective platforms solve real problems for developers, managers, and executives. But effectiveness alone isn’t enough to drive adoption. Platform teams must architect and market the IDP so developers want to use it. The platform as a product approach helps platform teams identify what an effective and compelling IDP looks like for their organization.
## What Is Platform as a Product?
The idea that platforms should be treated as products dates back to Evan Bottcher’s 2018 article “
[What I Talk About When I Talk About Platforms](https://martinfowler.com/articles/talk-about-platforms.html)”: *“*A key ingredient for success in finding this balance is that platforms must be compelling to use, they cannot stand on a mandate alone *.” *
“
[Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/)” co-authors Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton have expanded upon platform product management.
The platform as a product approach involves defining your mission, doing user research, using the minimum viable product (MVP) and thinnest viable platform (TVP) to allocate internal resources efficiently, and
[marketing your platform](https://thenewstack.io/the-art-of-platform-marketing-youve-gotta-sell-it/) internally to secure buy-in. Here’s what practitioners in the platform engineering community have shared about their experience.
### 1. Define Your Mission
New platform teams often encounter conflicting perspectives on their domain’s responsibilities, how to collaborate with other teams, and what success looks like.
[Creating a mission statement](https://medium.com/@michael.roy.galloway/your-platform-org-needs-a-purpose-heres-how-to-find-it-64874b082d80) can help define the platform team’s identity. At Doma, [Michael Galloway](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelroygalloway/)’s team interviewed developers, spoke to other stakeholder groups, and evaluated quantitative performance metrics to identify their purpose: “make it fast and easy to build great products.”
Strong mission statements are like good pop songs: they’re simple, meaningful, and make people feel something. “For a purpose to work, you have to feel it, not just know it,” says Galloway.
### 2. Do Your Research
Building a platform that solves real problems and wins developers’ hearts requires a deep understanding of their workflows, challenges, and how existing solutions fall short. Successful platform teams use various types of user research and feedback to inform their IDP roadmap. They strike a balance between the quantity and quality of feedback by choosing low- and high-touch research methods.
**Low touch**: Surveys quickly and efficiently gather broad sentiment and identify common pain points from a large developer pool. **Medium touch**: [Requests for Comments](https://leaddev.com/technical-decision-making/thorough-team-guide-rfcs)(RFCs) and individual interviews are more time-consuming but empower developers to elaborate on specific issues and propose solutions. **High touch**: Embedding platform advocates or enablement teams directly within development teams provide the richest feedback and context. This approach allows for real-time observation of workflows and firsthand experience of developer frustrations.
According to OpenCredo’s
[Nicki Watt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickiwatt/), a [technical platform product manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWPPnuQB4co) plays a crucial role here. They act as translators, synthesizing potentially conflicting perspectives into an actionable roadmap. They’ll do the work to understand what developers want and build something developers need.
Remember, user research shouldn’t be a one-time activity. It’s a continuous process throughout the platform’s life cycle. By consistently gathering feedback, platform teams can ensure the platform remains relevant and addresses evolving business needs.
### 3. Build a Minimum Viable Product and Maintain the Thinnest Viable Platform
Platforms have infinite potential, but platform teams have limited resources. Minimum viable product (MVP) and thinnest viable platform (TVP) are concepts that help optimally allocate those resources.
With an
[MVP approach](https://thenewstack.io/mvp-or-tvp-why-your-internal-developer-platform-needs-both/), platform teams create the most basic version of the product required to get user feedback. MVPs help platform teams validate core assumptions and avoid wasting resources on unnecessary or ineffective features. [Self-service documentation](https://thenewstack.io/documentation-is-more-than-your-thinnest-viable-platform/) can be an MVP. [TVP](https://github.com/TeamTopologies/Thinnest-Viable-Platform-examples) is a complementary concept introduced by Skelton and Pais: *“*The smallest set of APIs, documentation, and tools needed to accelerate the teams developing modern software services and systems. *”*
What constitutes a TVP naturally evolves over time. As third-party solutions become competitive with an organization’s internal tooling, platform teams must choose between maintaining built components or outsourcing to a vendor. With a TVP approach, platform teams allocate internal resources to only what provides unique business value.
### 4. Market Your Platform
Building an IDP is a significant undertaking. Platform teams must market their work to sustain buy-in from stakeholder groups across the organization.
In his 2023 PlatformCon talk “
[How to Communicate the Business Value of Platform Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBnnOcsKgyc),” Gartner’s [Manjunath Bhat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manjunathbhat/) noted that many platform teams struggle to explain the value of platform engineering beyond DevOps. This presents a problem when securing buy-in from non-engineering stakeholders who don’t understand how engineering improvements affect broader business priorities. Platform teams should learn to speak the language of different stakeholder groups when communicating business value. ![](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2024/03/27c73a8f-image2.png)

## Platform as a Product Challenge
One thing that makes the product approach challenging is that many teams think they are following it when they are not. Here are some common misconceptions Watt raised in
[her talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWPPnuQB4co) on the subject: **“Our users are just like us!”**Platform engineers are closer to their users and often unintentionally make more assumptions about them. However, building an effective and desirable product requires the same process regardless of whether the user is internal or external. **“We can just make the platform mandatory!”**Mandating platform adoption discourages developers from volunteering feedback and can create more security vulnerabilities overall. **“My way or the highway!”**Some platform teams assume it’s best to enforce one right way to do things. However, overly prescriptive platforms can force developers into less-than-optimal solutions. **“We don’t need a platform product manager!”**Some organizations balk at dedicating a PM to internal tooling. However, PMs focus on understanding developers’ challenges and maintaining relationships between the platform team and relevant stakeholders in a way that engineering managers or platform engineers can’t. **“Let’s get building right away!”**The problem with building first is that it assumes the best solution is technical. Successful platform teams use different forms of enablement where appropriate.
## Platform as a Product Key to Platform Engineering
The platform as a product approach is crucial for building successful IDPs. By treating the IDP as a product with a defined mission, user research, and targeted marketing, platform teams can ensure they’re building something developers not only need but want to use.
This approach isn’t without its challenges. Platform teams must avoid the temptation to make assumptions about internal users, mandate usage, or prioritize technical solutions over user enablement. That’s where the platform engineering community is here to help.
