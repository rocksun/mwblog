Given today’s fast-paced development practices and shift-left trend, the role of quality assurance (QA) is more essential than ever. With the drive to release high-quality software quickly, testing must be seamlessly integrated into [CI/CD pipelines](https://thenewstack.io/ci-cd/).

Yet, despite their expertise in writing and executing tests, many QA teams face challenges that extend beyond the boundaries of testing alone. They often find themselves grappling with infrastructure-related issues, requiring support from DevOps or platform engineering teams to fully realize their [testing workflows](https://thenewstack.io/a-5-step-framework-for-test-execution/). Let’s explore these challenges and discuss ways to empower QA teams, enabling a more integrated and agile approach to software delivery.

## The Struggles of QA in a CI/CD World
Quality assurance professionals are experts in [understanding software functionality](https://thenewstack.io/are-monolith-ci-cd-pipelines-killing-quality-in-your-software/), edge cases and user behavior. They design comprehensive test cases, analyze results and ensure that code meets quality standards before it reaches production. But in an environment where rapid, automated deployments are the norm, QA engineers often encounter roadblocks tied to infrastructure and platform management, which go beyond their traditional skill set.

### 1. Dependency on Platform Engineering for CI/CD Pipelines
CI/CD pipelines are the backbone of modern software integration and deployment, providing the automated way from code commit to production. For QA teams, these pipelines should ideally facilitate test execution at every step of the process. However, building, maintaining and scaling testing within these pipelines require infrastructure skills that are typically within the domain of DevOps or platform engineering, not QA or testers. Consequently, QA teams often rely on these teams to set up and manage the pipelines, which can create bottlenecks and dependencies that slow down the testing process.

### 2. Challenges in Provisioning Test Environments
Ideally, test environments should be stable, consistent and as close to production as possible. However, provisioning and maintaining such environments is no small feat. It requires robust infrastructure knowledge to handle container orchestration, scaling, network configurations and other technical complexities like ephemeral environments. Without these environments readily available, QA teams find it difficult to conduct thorough testing, and the lack of autonomy over environment management hinders their ability to move quickly and efficiently.

### 3. Complexity of Deploying the Application Under Test
Deploying applications for [testing involves more than just running code](https://thenewstack.io/stop-running-tests-with-your-ci-cd-tool/). It requires managing dependencies, handling configurations and ensuring that deployments are isolated to avoid interference with other workflows. For many QA engineers, the intricacies of deployment pipelines fall outside their core expertise, making them reliant on DevOps teams to handle application deployments. This dependency can lead to delays, particularly when DevOps resources are limited, slowing down the overall testing process and affecting product releases.

## Going Forward: Enabling QA Teams to Work Autonomously
To bridge this gap, organizations must enable QA teams to take greater ownership of their testing workflows and reduce dependencies on platform engineering. Here are several approaches to consider:

### 1. Implement Self-Service Platforms for Testing Environments
By providing QA teams with self-service platforms, organizations can empower them to provision and manage test environments on demand. Kubernetes and containerization tools like Docker can help streamline this process, enabling QA engineers to spin up isolated environments without requiring DevOps intervention. Self-service platforms can be tailored to automatically include necessary configurations, ensuring that environments are reliable, consistent and as close to production as possible.

### 2. Incorporate Testing Into Self-Service Platforms
As platform engineers strive to implement a self-service approach to building new components and services, this approach should include necessary templates and workflows for testing activities also, including:

- Templates for both functional and nonfunctional tests using the preferred testing tool(s) selected by the QA team.
- Configurations that integrate the execution of these test templates into provisioned CI/CD pipelines.
- Tools and dashboard(s) for troubleshooting failed tests and tracking quality metrics over time — integrated into a corresponding developer portal as applicable.
### 3. Build Collaborative CI/CD Pipelines
By involving QA in the pipeline design process and providing them with simplified tools, platform engineering can foster a more collaborative approach to pipeline management. For example, platforms that allow QA to control test parameters, add or modify test stages, and customize test workflows can reduce dependencies and give QA greater control over the testing process

### 3. Automate the Deployment Process for Testing
[Automating deployments for test environments](https://thenewstack.io/test-automation-tools-unite/) can minimize the reliance on DevOps while ensuring consistency. By using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and templated deployment scripts, QA teams can trigger test environment deployments autonomously, reducing wait times and increasing testing efficiency. Organizations can also consider implementing [blue/green](https://testkube.io/learn/automating-blue-green-deployments-with-argo-rollouts-and-testkube) or [canary deployments](https://testkube.io/learn/automate-canary-deployments-with-argo-rollouts-and-testkube) in test environments, allowing QA teams to test specific versions of an application in isolated, production-like settings.
### 4. Invest in Training and Cross-Skilling
To further empower QA, consider investing in training that enhances their infrastructure knowledge, particularly in areas like Kubernetes, IaC and CI/CD tooling. A cross-functional team approach can also help where platform engineers and QA work closely together to share knowledge and skills. Over time, QA engineers can build the foundational skills they need to manage basic infrastructure tasks, allowing DevOps to focus on more complex or organizationwide concerns.

## Bridging the Gap With Testkube
At Testkube, we understand that empowering QA teams to overcome infrastructure challenges is critical to achieving seamless, automated testing processes. Our platform is designed to simplify test orchestration within Kubernetes environments, enabling QA teams to manage tests, environments and workflows without requiring extensive infrastructure knowledge. [Testkube](https://testkube.io) integrates with popular CI/CD platforms, making it easier for QAs to deploy, execute and monitor tests autonomously while still collaborating effectively with DevOps and platform engineering teams.

## Fostering a Collaborative, Autonomous Testing Culture
As organizations continue to scale and embrace faster development cycles, bridging the gap between QA and platform engineering becomes imperative. By providing QA teams with the tools, training and autonomy to handle infrastructure-related challenges, organizations can create a more efficient and agile testing process. This, in turn, drives faster releases, higher-quality software and a more collaborative development environment.
