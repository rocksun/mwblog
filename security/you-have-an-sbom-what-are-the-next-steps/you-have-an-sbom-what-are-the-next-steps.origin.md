Just as architects rely on blueprints to know the details of a building, software developers use a specific resource to track each component within their applications: the
[software bill of materials (SBOM)](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-create-a-software-bill-of-materials/).
As a detailed inventory, an SBOM helps you know every component within your
[software supply chain](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/articles/what-is-software-supply-chain), from proprietary code to open source. By keeping a comprehensive list, you can be better equipped to enhance security and quickly address vulnerabilities.
But a key question remains: Once you have an SBOM, what are the next steps?
## Validate Your SBOM
An SBOM is more than a list of components. It’s
[an essential document](https://www.sonatype.com/blog/why-sboms-are-essential-for-every-organization) to help maintain software transparency and integrity. The true value emerges when you validate an SBOM and confirm its contents accurately represent the current state of your software.
Consider the following steps for SBOM validation:
**Verify component accuracy:**Use automated tools to cross-check the SBOM against your actual [software dependencies](https://thenewstack.io/a-guide-to-software-dependencies/), and update the SBOM to correct discrepancies. **Confirm version consistency:**Ensure the versions listed match those in your build environment to identify any outdated components needing updates. **Check licensing information:**Verify each component’s licensing details are accurate to maintain compliance and avoid legal risks. **Scan for known vulnerabilities:**Use [software composition analysis (SCA)](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/articles/what-is-software-composition-analysis)tools to compare SBOM components against vulnerability databases, ensuring they are free from high-risk issues. **Document validation results:**Keep records of your validation process and any remediation actions to streamline future audits and enhance security responses.
Consistent SBOM validation enhances decision-making, enables tracing of component origins and improves security. By offering transparency into all components, it reduces reliance on vendor claims and streamlines audits. Regular validation also ensures components are up to date, supporting a proactive security posture.
## Add Software Composition Analysis
One of the most effective ways to secure your software is with a combined practice of SBOM management and SCA. While SBOMs provide a list of components, SCA tools analyze those components for licensing issues, compliance risks and vulnerabilities.
Together,
[SBOM management and SCA](https://thenewstack.io/software-composition-analysis-and-sboms-a-united-defense/) build a comprehensive approach to managing your software supply chain.
As a dual approach, consider these tactics:
**Cross-check compliance and security:**Once validated, an SBOM can cross-reference SCA scan results. This helps detect discrepancies, ensuring SBOM and SCA findings align, and addresses licensing, quality and security issues. **Augment SCA with SBOM insights:**SBOMs can enhance SCA scans by shedding light on harder-to-assess areas like databases or operating systems, ensuring a more thorough risk evaluation.
SBOM management with SCA creates a holistic view of your software and helps maintain its integrity. This facilitates proactive risk management, ensures compliance with regulatory standards and secures your software against potential threats.
## Integrate SBOMs Into the Development Life Cycle
To maximize SBOM benefits,
[integrate them into your SDLC](https://www.sonatype.com/blog/how-to-integrate-sboms-into-the-software-development-life-cycle) and automate the process whenever possible. This ensures real-time updates, maintaining accuracy as your software evolves. Regular updates reduce the risk of outdated data, enhancing transparency and security.
Automating SBOM creation by integrating them into CI/CD pipelines ensures an SBOM with each build, providing a reliable record of software components. By setting up quality gates in your CI/CD workflows, you can scan SBOMs for security vulnerabilities and licensing issues, stopping noncompliant components from moving forward in deployment.
During quality assurance (QA), SBOMs are vital for ensuring compliance and security before release. They ensure each release meets industry standards and best practices. By integrating SBOMs into CI/CD and QA processes, development teams establish a robust framework for transparency and compliance, boosting software supply chain security at all stages.
## Manage and Monitor SBOMs for Vulnerabilities
Effective SBOM management extends beyond the development phase. Once in production, SBOMs need to be continuously monitored to ensure ongoing security and compliance, especially as new vulnerabilities emerge.
To effectively monitor SBOMs, consider these best practices:
**Maintenance of an SBOM archive:**Create an up-to-date repository for all SBOMs related to software in production or delivered to customers. This archive is vital for auditing and tracking component changes throughout the SDLC. **Long-term retention:**Keep SBOMs for the entire duration a software version is in use. This supports compliance and enables quick responses to vulnerabilities. **Proactive risk management:**When you find a vulnerability, use your SBOM archive to quickly identify and fix the affected components. This enables rapid remediation and reduces exposure. **Third-party SBOM monitoring:**Regularly monitor SBOMs from third-party vendors to improve your response to [zero-day vulnerabilities](https://thenewstack.io/zero-day-vulnerabilities-a-beginners-guide/)and software supply chain attacks.
With these best practices, you can
[mitigate risks and protect your software](https://thenewstack.io/navigating-open-source-software-risks-whose-job-is-it-anyway/) from security threats while maintaining compliance with industry standards.
## Leverage SBOMs for Long-Term Security
As SBOM adoption grows, organizations must enhance their management practices to ensure robust software security,
[particularly with open source](https://thenewstack.io/a-guide-to-open-source-software-security/).
By focusing on validation, integration and monitoring, you can count on your SBOMs as powerful resources for managing software security and compliance.
This approach not only creates a more transparent and accountable software development process, but also strengthens defenses against vulnerabilities and software supply chain attacks.
