SEATTLE —
[SPDX](https://thenewstack.io/spdx-software-supply-chain-spec-becomes-an-iso-standard/), the open standard for “System” Bill of Materials, takes a major step forward.
For years, we needed a standard way for companies to standardize their license and component information (metadata) in
[software bills of material (SBOM)](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-create-a-software-bill-of-materials/) to ease the discovery and labeling of open source components in their products.
The answer to that problem is
[Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)](https://spdx.dev/), aka the International Standards Organization (ISO) standard: [ISO/IEC 5962:2021](https://www.iso.org/standard/81870.html). Now, at [Open Source Summit North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/) in Seattle, the latest version, SPDX 3.0, has made its appearance.
“It’d been a six-year slog, but SPDX now lays out not just the format for a software bill of materials but for everything,” said
[Bob Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-martin-589579/), senior principal software and supply chain assurance engineer at the [Mitre Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/).
Thus, going forward, SPDX will now be called System Package Data Exchange — indicating its usefulness beyond just software.
How does the new System Package Data Exchange encompass “everything”? By adding SPDX profiles. It starts with a core SPDX profile that includes all programs, hardware projects, AI, Software as a Service, you name it. Above it are profiles for additional metadata for security, licensing and build information.
SPDX has become much more useful with SPDX profiles. It offers subsets of information finely tuned for popular use cases such as security, precise licensing, AI model training and more. This enhancement streamlines the use of SPDX, empowering stakeholders across the development, security, data science and legal sectors.
If that sounds great but complicated, well, you’re right. To make it easier to put SPDX 3.0 to work it Includes ready-to-use profile templates. This will simplify adoption and implementation for developers and end-users.
## Seeking Adoption by Developers
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is also going out of its way to make it easy for programmers to adopt it. “We added SPDX exports to GitHub’s dependency graph to make it easy for developers to meet regulatory requirements, and we’ve seen enthusiastic adoption from the community in response,” said [Justin Hutchings](https://github.com/jhutchings1), GitHub’s senior director of product management.
“Increasing the transparency in the
[software supply chain](https://thenewstack.io/openssf-boosts-software-supply-chain-security-with-slsa-1-0/) is an important foundation to building a more secure world.”
That’s important because SPDX isn’t just a good idea; it’s the law — at least in the United States.
[Executive Order 14028](https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-14028-improving-nations-cybersecurity) requires a “formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building software,” similar to food ingredient labels on the packaging. In short, an SBOM.
An SBOM doesn’t need to use SPDX. There are other standard SBOM formats, such as
[CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) and [Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)](https://cpe.mitre.org/about/). However, as an ISO standard and with profiles extending SPDX to essentially any platform or process, SPDX seems to be a safe bet for becoming the dominant standard.
As
[Melissa Evers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissaevers/), [Intel’s](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/now/data-centric/overview.html?utm_content=inline+mention) vice president of its software and advanced technology group, said, “Intel embraces open international standards that help provide transparency and disclosure of security information, complying with emergent regulations.
“The release of SPDX version 3 is an important milestone, as its modular design allows for the recording of multiple facets of information on software components, including security and licensing.”
With support from numerous other software and security companies and organizations, it seems a sure bet that SPDX 3.0 will be the SBOM standard in the years ahead.
