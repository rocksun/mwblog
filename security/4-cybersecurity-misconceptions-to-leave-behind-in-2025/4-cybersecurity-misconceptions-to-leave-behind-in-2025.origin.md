# 4 Cybersecurity Misconceptions to Leave Behind in 2025
Most people know that cyberthreats lurk around every corner. Be it an opportunistic lone criminal or a hacker with the power of a nation-state behind them, it can feel like the world and its dog want to access your private data.

Beyond this, though, how well do people grasp the threat? According to CybSafe’s [latest research](https://www.cybsafe.com/whitepapers/oh-behave-the-annual-cybersecurity-attitudes-and-behaviors-report-24-25/), which surveyed over 7,000 individuals across “The Five Eyes” nations, Germany, and India, the answer is decidedly mixed. While signs suggest an uptick in cyber awareness among workers in some areas, many of us still harbor inaccurate or outdated beliefs about our online security.

Many start the year vowing to break bad habits, though many resolutions may quickly fall by the wayside. Cybercriminals, however, remain disciplined and better equipped than ever. In the spirit of transformation, here are “the four horsemen” of cyber misconceptions — and how businesses and workers can resolve to leave them behind in 2025.

**Overconfidence **
**Sixty-Seven Percent of Participants Feel Confident in Recognizing Phishing Attempts**
Sixty-seven percent of “Oh, Behave! Report” respondents were confident that they could recognize phishing attempts. While this initially looks promising, it will do little to reassure CISOs — in fact, it’s likely to send their blood pressure skywards. While we may believe our ability to spot scams is flawless, bad actors constantly evolve. When we think about spotting a scam, we likely picture emails filled with spelling mistakes or pop-ups announcing we’ve won a prize as the millionth visitor. But scams have evolved far beyond these stereotypes. Today’s threats are far more sophisticated. Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular, is changing the game’s rules: just as it helps write that last-minute report, it can help criminals construct more elaborate and convincing scams.

Workers need to avoid falling into a false sense of security, and organizations must ensure that they are frequently updating advice and strategies to reduce the likelihood of their employees falling victim.

In addition, we found that this confidence doesn’t necessarily translate into action. A notable portion of those surveyed (29%) admit that they don’t report suspicious messages even when they do identify a phishing scam, despite the presence of convenient reporting tools like “report phishing” buttons.

What can organizations do to improve this figure? One “resolution” they can take is based on simple behavioral incentives. Skepticism about whether reporting tools have an impact is common, and many claim that they would be more likely to report scams if they had tangible signs of progress. Finding fewer spam emails in their inbox would help, but more straightforwardly, acknowledging that their report is being looked into would improve the rates at which workers flag scams.

**Apathy **
**Thirty Percent ****Expressed That There Is No Point in Protecting Themselves as Their Information Is Already Online**
Our second misconception stems from workers’ sense of helplessness. This kind of cyber apathy can become a dangerous self-fulfilling prophecy if left unaddressed.

The key problem is that even if it’s true that information is already online, this isn’t equivalent to being directly under threat, and there are different levels of risk. It’s one thing knowing someone has your home address; knowing they have your front door key in their pocket is quite another. Even if it’s hard to [keep all of your data](https://thenewstack.io/7-llm-risks-and-api-management-strategies/) hidden, that doesn’t mean it’s not worth taking steps to keep key information protected. While it can seem impossible to [stay safe when so much personal data](https://thenewstack.io/federated-learning-lets-data-stay-distributed/) is publicly available, this should be the impetus to bolster cybersecurity practices, such as not including personal information in passwords.

Another variation of this is a concern about cost. Around half (52%) of those asked said it’s too expensive to protect themselves online fully. This is an understandable sentiment, and it presents a real problem for businesses when most of their workers feel they can’t afford the necessary protection. In fact, with many businesses continuing to support and expand flexible work-from-home policies, it’s more important than ever that workers feel confident and supported in playing their part to protect company data. There is an opportunity here. As organizations look at the year ahead, they can invest resources to protect themselves and their workers by lifting a perceived burden that often limits their engagement with cybersecurity practices.

**Complacency **
**Twenty-Eight Percent of Participants Who Don’t Use Multifactor Authentication (MFA) Said They Felt Their Password Was Strong Enough Already**
Continuing our run of eyebrow-raising stats, we found that nearly a third of participants who decided to forgo multifactor authentication in 2024 did so because they felt their password was strong enough.

Again, this is an understandable response — but it misses the purpose of MFA. No matter how strong your password is, it’s as good as “1234” if it gets exposed in a leak. MFA adds another layer of protection against bad actors. As we look forward to 2025’s [evolving threat landscape](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-security-report-evolving-landscape-of-devsecops/), organizations should encourage a “both… and” approach to MFA and strong passwords — not “either…or”.

A breakdown of those who frequently did use MFA is potentially even more concerning for businesses. Even of those seemingly more security-conscious respondents, most primarily used MFA for banking and finance apps (81%). This figure drops dramatically to just 39% regarding work accounts, including email. Once again, the answer isn’t to lecture employees on why their work email is just as important as their personal banking — it’s down to businesses to make it as straightforward as possible for their employees to set up and use MFA in the workplace, and understand its importance in the context of today’s threat landscape.

**Uncertainty **
**1/4 Were Neutral on Whether They Felt Their Devices Were Secure**
Last, we have the dreaded “don’t know.” Approximately a quarter of those we surveyed didn’t know how protected they were online or how they could improve their security.

This is the least surprising stat for CISOs. Indeed, in my experience, many workers aren’t especially tuned into their cybersecurity one way or the other. This might be frustrating for security professionals, but it’s understandable: People are busy! Many feel they do not have the time or mental capacity to add maintenance of good cyber hygiene to their to-do lists. Counterintuitively perhaps, this also makes it the easiest of our four misconceptions to address. It suggests that these employees are open to education — but it also may indicate that traditional training through video courses isn’t working as well as firms would like.

In this case, firms would do well beyond past training regimes, which are often time-consuming and can feel meaningless additional work. Behavioral changes, careful data collection, and personalized advice can all help minimize uncertainty and create a better-informed and more vigilant workforce.

**New Year, New Security**
Everyone knows New Year’s Resolutions are tough to keep. People struggle to stick to goals and find themselves making the same mistakes year on year. On top of this, lousy cybersecurity habits are considered among the most unshakeable of all — but they don’t have to be. One positive note to end on is that over the four years we’ve conducted this research, the data shows that, for the most part, these misconceptions are gradually shrinking. If decision-makers resolve to tackle the misconceptions outlined, then I’m confident they’ll see real progress in the year ahead.

Four common and troubling misconceptions — but each with practical routes to addressing them. Nobody said maintaining high-security standards was easy — if it were, everyone would do it. The important thing is that business leaders don’t give in to apathy either. If they want workers to prioritize cybersecurity, they need to lead by example. By addressing even a few of these misconceptions, enterprises can make significant strides in 2025 toward improving their cyberculture and better protecting themselves, their employees, and their customers from looming threats.
