The software industry stands at a crossroads. The rise of supply-chain attacks over the past decade has left an indelible mark on the industry.

High-profile incidents such as [SolarWinds](https://thenewstack.io/solarwinds-the-worlds-biggest-security-failure-and-open-sources-better-answer/) and the exploitation of the [Log4Shell vulnerability](https://thenewstack.io/log4shell-hacks-on-and-on/) have exposed systemic weaknesses in the way we build and distribute software. These events transformed trusted tools into attack vectors, leaving organizations powerless to respond until after the damage was done. If the past decade has taught us anything, it is that the status quo is no longer sustainable.

What does the next decade hold for software supply-chain security? And how can the industry transform to meet the challenges of 2035? By addressing the root causes of supply-chain vulnerabilities and fostering a culture of proactive, integrated security, we can build a future where innovation and security are not just compatible but mutually reinforcing.

## From Reactive to Proactive: Building a New Paradigm
Traditional approaches to software security are often reactive. Tools designed to identify vulnerabilities or detect malware have historically been the first line of defense. But these tools leave organizations exposed to attacks that could have been prevented.

It’s as if you installed a security camera in your home that records intrusions but does nothing to prevent them. In a modern development environment, being reactive is insufficient. We need security measures that prevent threats from entering the software supply chain in the first place.

Emerging standards for end-to-end software integrity offer a glimpse into this proactive future. [Cryptographic signatures](https://thenewstack.io/cryptographic-keys-in-a-cloud-native-environment/) on software artifacts, combined with real-time verification of their provenance, can ensure that only trusted components enter the development pipeline.

## A Vision for 2035
By 2035, we envision a radically transformed landscape for software supply-chain security. Here’s what the future could look like:

**Minimal, immutable artifacts:**Every piece of software deployed to production will include only the minimal set of components required to build and run the application. This will improve performance, decrease attack surface and enhance zero-trust security postures.**Continuous updates, fewer vulnerabilities:**Software will be continually rebuilt from source, minimizing deviations from upstream and decreasing security vulnerabilities. This enables developers to consume not only novel functionality, but also the latest patches — meaning zero or a low number of vulnerabilities in production. Organizations will no longer rely on unsupported or frozen software that requires disruptive maintenance and, eventually, major system overhauls. Software ages like milk, not wine.**End-to-end integrity:**Just as that syntax highlighting has become a staple of modern IDEs, real-time verification of software dependencies will be integrated directly into every stage of the SDLC. Developers won’t have to ask, “Can I trust this dependency or artifact?” because their tooling will verify it for them and block untrusted software from their environments.
These advancements will not only enhance security but also accelerate development by eliminating manual, error-prone processes. Security will no longer be a bottleneck but a catalyst for innovation.

## Overcoming Barriers
This vision for the next decade is ambitious, and major challenges remain, such as finding the right balance between innovation and security. For businesses, shipping software quickly and efficiently is paramount to winning. That’s why security must be seamlessly integrated into existing development workflows without adding friction. Security solutions that slow down deployments or require significant manual intervention just won’t work. The industry must prioritize building scalable security architectures that function at the speed of modern SDLC, where robust CI/CD pipelines deploy code continuously. Instead of treating security as an additional layer, security must be natively embedded into software development and deployment.

Which brings us to the importance of open source software. Open source has thrived because of its accessibility and flexibility. Enhanced security measures must not come at the cost of the openness that has fueled innovation. Balancing security with openness will require thoughtful design and a commitment to preserving the collaborative spirit of the open source community.

## Building Trust Through Verification
For too long, trust was an implicit assumption in software development. Five years ago, developers trusted that the libraries they used were secure, that the container images they deployed were free of vulnerabilities and that their supply chains were not compromised. But that trust was misplaced.

The future of software supply-chain security depends on replacing implicit trust with explicit verification. Standardized tools and processes must be designed to ensure the integrity of every component, so trust is established through cryptographic proofs rather than assumptions. This mindset shift will require significant investment in tooling, standards and education, but the benefits will mean developers can build and ship software with confidence..

For example, organizations that adopt robust supply-chain security practices will not only reduce their exposure to risk but also gain a competitive advantage. In an era where trust is synonymous with value, companies that can demonstrate the integrity of their software will earn the confidence of their customers and partners.

## A Call to Collective Action
The path to a secure and innovative future requires immediate action. The building blocks of this transformation are already in place, but it will take further commitment and collaboration from developers, enterprises and policymakers to realize their full potential. We all have a role to play in shaping the future of software supply-chain security.

As we look to 2035, let’s imagine a world where every line of code is secure by default, where trust is verified, and where innovation and security are no longer at odds. The organizations that begin adapting this vision today will be the ones that thrive tomorrow.
