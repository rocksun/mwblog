In the modern
[shifting landscape](https://www.sonatype.com/blog/the-shifting-landscape-of-open-source-supply-chain-attacks) of [software supply chain](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/articles/what-is-software-supply-chain) attacks, maintaining robust and resilient software development is fundamental.
With the
[ increasing reliance on open source software components](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/a-summary-of-census-ii-open-source-software-application-libraries-the-world-depends-on), complications associated with managing [security vulnerabilities](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/articles/what-are-open-source-vulnerabilities) and compliance also crop up.
In response to this increasing complexity,
[software composition analysis (SCA)](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/articles/what-is-software-composition-analysis) and [software bill of materials (SBOM)](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/articles/what-is-software-bill-of-materials) management have emerged as core approaches for software development teams to defend against cyberthreats.
Let’s explore these two approaches and why their dual use is essential for secure and efficient software development.
## The Role of SCA: Build Right the First Time
SCA is a forward-looking approach that helps identify and manage security vulnerabilities in open source software components early in the
[software development life cycle (SDLC)](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/articles/guide-to-software-development-life-cycle).
This early detection comprises part of a
[shift-left](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/articles/what-is-shift-left) security approach, enabling teams to mitigate vulnerabilities before they escalate into more significant threats.
The effectiveness of SCA lies in its comprehensive risk assessment, which empowers developers to make informed decisions about the components they integrate into their projects.
Beyond its foundational aim of early vulnerability detection, SCA offers additional benefits that enhance security and compliance throughout the development process:
**Continuous monitoring:**SCA ensures ongoing surveillance of open source components, identifying new vulnerabilities or changes in licensing, thereby maintaining a [secure software environment](https://thenewstack.io/a-guide-to-open-source-software-security/)over time. **License compliance:**By managing both observed and declared licenses, SCA helps ensure adherence to licensing obligations, thereby mitigating legal risks associated with the use of open source software. **Policy enforcement:**SCA guides developers in the selection and use of components that are safe and architecturally sound, and tailored to the specific requirements of their application.
By integrating these features, SCA not only helps build software that is
[secure by design](https://www.sonatype.com/blog/a-demand-for-real-consequences-sonatypes-response-to-cisas-secure-by-design) but also supports continuous improvement and compliance.
## The Role of SBOM Management: Enhance Transparency
SBOM management provides a detailed inventory of every software component within an application, encompassing both open source and proprietary elements and listing all packages, libraries and
[dependencies](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/articles/what-are-software-dependencies), offering unprecedented transparency into the software’s makeup.
This inventory offers unparalleled transparency that’s crucial for security, compliance and operational efficiency. It enables organizations to swiftly address vulnerabilities, audit third-party software and satisfy regulatory demands.
In addition to component transparency, SBOM management offers the following benefits:
**Application vulnerability management:**SBOM management aids in the rapid detection and remediation of vulnerabilities within any listed component, enhancing the security posture of applications, whether they are developed in house or are acquired. **Compliance and risk assessment:**It supports stringent adherence to regulations and standards, greatly simplifying the process of [comprehensive risk evaluation](https://thenewstack.io/navigating-open-source-software-risks-whose-job-is-it-anyway/)and ensuring regulatory compliance. **Software supply chain security:**By providing a clear view of a software supply chain, SBOM management reduces the risk of supply chain attacks and ensures the integrity of software components. **Software supply chain transparency:**SBOM management helps demonstrate secure development practices to customers, users and regulators efficiently and in formats that adhere to industry standards.
SBOM management not only enhances the transparency and security of software systems but also ensures that organizations can maintain high standards of compliance.
## Why You Need Both SCA and SBOM Management
SCA and SBOM management are complementary approaches that together form a robust framework for software security and compliance.
While SCA identifies and mitigates risks in open source components, SBOM management provides a complete overview of all software elements, enhancing transparency for effective governance, risk management and compliance (GRC).
Integrating both SCA and SBOM management into the SDLC delivers a comprehensive approach to security and compliance to:
**Enhance security posture:**The combination of SCA’s detailed vulnerability analysis with SBOM’s comprehensive inventory allows teams to rapidly identify and address risks throughout the software stack. **Streamline compliance:**SBOMs offer the essential documentation needed for regulatory compliance, while SCA supports risk management, together facilitating easier compliance processes. **Facilitate operational efficiency:**The clarity from SBOMs, alongside actionable insights from SCA, optimizes decision-making, enhances collaboration and accelerates remediation efforts.
This dual approach not only helps in identifying and remedying risks across the software stack but also ensures compliance and licensing purposes.
## A United Defense Against Cyberthreats
Adopting both SCA and
[SBOM management](https://www.sonatype.com/products/sonatype-sbom-manager) exemplifies a best-practice approach for secure and efficient development in the face of rising cyberthreats.
This dual strategy not only aids in identifying and addressing risks but also ensures comprehensive documentation for compliance and licensing.
The collaboration of SCA and SBOM management empowers development teams to deliver secure, compliant and robust software, safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities and ensuring the highest security standards.
