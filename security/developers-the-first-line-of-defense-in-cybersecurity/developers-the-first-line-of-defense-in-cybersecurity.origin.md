As [cyberthreats](https://thenewstack.io/security/) like LockBit, RockForYou24, and others become increasingly sophisticated, developers are most commonly on the front lines of defending against security breaches and protecting sensitive data.

Security is no longer a separate responsibility from coding. It’s an integral part of the development process from start to finish. This is how the idea of [DevSecOps](https://thenewstack.io/decoding-devsecops-striking-the-right-balance/) came to be — developers and security experts are a unified team working together to combat threats.

To achieve unity, company leaders must develop a [risk management methodology](https://secureframe.com/blog/risk-management-methodologies) so that developers, security teams, and the entire organization are on the same page about handling security threats.

By developing and defining [a risk management methodology](https://thenewstack.io/we-need-to-rethink-risk-in-vulnerability-management/), adopting secure coding practices, staying vigilant about updates, and integrating security into every workflow, developers can play a critical role in safeguarding their organization’s entire infrastructure.

## Managing Risk Together
There are two basic approaches to risk assessment: qualitative and quantitative. With a qualitative approach, high probability and high-impact risks are prioritized. Risks with low probability and low impact are not prioritized. On the other hand, a quantitative approach uses data to measure the likelihood and impact of individual risks. While this method is more precise, it does require access to reliable data, analytical tools, and internal expertise.

Qualitative assessments might initially be best suited for startups or companies with limited resources, but no matter [the framework](https://secureframe.com/frameworks) you choose, putting a risk management plan in place is the first step in aligning and working together with the engineering and security teams.

## Playing Defense as a Developer
Developers are constantly playing defense against bad actors, which means they need to implement secure coding practices from the start. Input validation, proper data sanitization, and secure API design should be prioritized to prevent malicious data from harming the company’s API or its end users.

Embracing a “[Secure by Design](https://secureframe.com/blog/secure-by-design)” approach is crucial. This methodology focuses on systematically eliminating vulnerabilities before deployment rather than dealing with the consequences after the fact. Developers are pivotal in implementing secure design principles and should be trained in secure coding practices and vulnerability testing. Some best practices include:

- Using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks
- Opting for memory-safe programming languages to reduce the risk of buffer overflows
- Implementing hardware-backed cryptographic key management for enhanced security
- Integrating cloud platforms and developer tools into a single security compliance automation dashboard to centralize vulnerability monitoring from services like AWS Inspector and GitHub
It’s important to remember that threats constantly evolve, and you can only be vigilant if you know what you’re guarding against. Vulnerability databases like NVD, CVE, and Exploit Database can help developers stay ahead of emerging threats by helping them understand critical indicators of an attack and which parts of their infrastructure might be particularly vulnerable at any given time.

Authoritative bodies like NIST, CISA, and OWASP offer guidance on the most common vulnerabilities and how to avoid them. For example, broken access control (when an attacker gains access to system data with the ability to modify or delete it) is becoming increasingly common. One way to guard against broken access control is to ensure access is authorized at the code level for each resource and deny access by default. This should be considered a critical responsibility of developers.

SAST (Static Application Security Testing), threat modeling, and CI/CD are also core engineering practices that can mitigate security risks. SAST tools can identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development cycle, allowing developers to fix them quickly and avoid wasting money on remediation. Recent studies attribute a decline in vulnerabilities to automated testing and CI/CD practices, with one report noting a significant decrease in vulnerabilities found in target applications – from 97% in 2020 to 83% in 2022. This encouraging trend suggests that code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration are helping to reduce common programming errors.

Threat modeling requires close collaboration between system architects and security teams to identify company assets that could be targeted, model different threat scenarios, such as social engineering or malware, and create protection mechanisms for each case. Developers should also integrate security checks into their CI/CD pipeline to identify and address vulnerabilities before code is deployed.

## Continuous Vigilance
Applying system updates regularly is one of the most essential preventative actions developers can take to defend against attacks. When a vulnerability is discovered, developers should immediately apply patches and updates to all software components and systems. Not only is patch management integral to preventing attacks, but it also ensures your company complies with security and privacy regulations.

By prioritizing these actions, developers can help mitigate the risk of security breaches and vulnerabilities in their organization’s tech stack. The most respected organizations incorporate security into every phase of the software development life cycle to achieve a robust security posture. However, it’s essential to recognize that monitoring and managing risk is ongoing.

Automated compliance tooling can significantly enhance an organization’s ability to evaluate security safeguards and identify weaknesses. These tools provide a clear picture of your risk profile and security posture, allowing for more efficient and effective risk management. By leveraging such technology, companies can streamline compliance efforts, reduce human error, and stay ahead of evolving threats.

Combining developer vigilance, secure coding practices, and advanced automated compliance solutions creates a powerful defense against cybersecurity risks. This holistic approach protects sensitive data and fosters a culture of security awareness throughout the organization.
