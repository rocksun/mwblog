For security practitioners, BlackHat and Defcon provide the ultimate one-two punch of the industry. At BlackHat, you get to see the full vendor marketing budgets on display — we’re talking steak dinners, helicopter rides, cigar nights, nightclubs and everything in between (shoutout to Corgea’s blowouts, though). At Defcon, you get to see the amazing research that drives the industry forward, from hacking cars to bus passes, the real exploits that get practitioners excited.

These environments create an almost impossible environment for practitioners to navigate as they try to understand what the evolving threat landscape really looks like and what vendors are working on to help make their lives easier and their wallets lighter.

We put together five brief takeaways from the shows to help practitioners navigate what’s really happening:

## 1: Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) Is the New Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)

Most enterprises are dealing with a cobbled web of multiple cloud environments, with some on-premises footprint alongside them. For a long time now, CSPM has evolved into a larger vulnerability management effort, as toxic combinations and vulnerability prioritization in overall infrastructure context have become the norm. Despite this focus, vulnerability counts tend to only go up and to the right, without great ways to feel like you’re making a dent in vulnerability counts.

In the last year, we’ve seen a ton of new ways to do contextual prioritization that will need greater elucidation for the market, but ultimately have been called reachability. There are a ton of definitions of what this really means, and we’ve written [about those here](https://pulse.latio.tech/p/everything-to-know-about-runtime). The goal here is more time fixing things that are real, and less time chasing ghosts.

Some examples of this trend from BlackHat are:

1. Zafran releasing a vulnerability scanning agent to offer native coverage of vulnerabilities alongside their attack path data.
2. Wiz releasing an on-premises scanner and the ability to ingest findings from other platforms to serve multicloud and on-premises environments.
3. Tenable pushing its CTEM solution and Vulcan acquisition, combining the data from its cloud and on-premises scanners.
4. Qualys pushing a risk operations center concept, creating a vulnerability management framework similar to the work of the security operations center (SOC).
5. Palo Alto’s Cortex ASPM ingesting vulnerabilities from third-party scanners.

## 2: Innovative Runtime Solutions Add Layer of Vital Visibility

While it’s hard to get through the [AI hype](https://thenewstack.io/ai-security-needs-better-infrastructure-not-more-tools/), the solutions making real differences for teams are being driven by greater [visibility into runtime workloads](https://thenewstack.io/how-runtime-hardening-enforces-ai-cloud-native-security/). While there’s a ton of confusion and vendor capabilities on the vulnerability management side, these solutions are frankly easier to make and deal with managing and prioritizing large datasets.

Conversely, building [meaningful runtime protection](https://thenewstack.io/how-runtime-hardening-enforces-ai-cloud-native-security/) for cloud workloads is really challenging, but pays off with some big results. Here are some of the leading innovations happening:

1. Application detection and response, providing visibility into how your application works at runtime via simple agent-based instrumentation.
2. Cloud application detection and response, extending application visibility solutions into the operating system and cloud layers for complete cloud workload defense.
3. Proactive workload defense, with solutions like [Edera](https://edera.dev) focused on secure-by-default workloads and true [container isolation](https://thenewstack.io/what-we-wish-we-knew-about-container-security/) at runtime.

## 3: The SOC Is HOT!

We’re seeing most security operations teams being pushed by their executives on two fronts:

1. Investing in AI to have a compelling story for their board, alongside general promises of efficiency and optimization.
2. Scaling the way they interact with data more efficiently.

These priorities are renewing attention on the SOC, which had previously been overshadowed by cloud and application security teams. AI is now being touted as a solution to speeding up incident response and enabling more complex triage. However, solutions in this category are still very early, and hands-on time is practically nonexistent beyond trusted design partners.

Teams are in a tough spot right now when it comes to deciding on an AI adoption strategy, given the overwhelming number of options — data optimization tools, third-party APIs, browser plugins, security information and event management (SIEM) replacements — without any clear answers on which will be the most effective. Layered on top of this, the traditional challenges remain: Detection engineering is hard, cloud and application visibility is limited and staffing and training are ongoing hurdles. All together, it makes the SOC a particularly noisy place to be this year.

## 4: The Code Security Divide Is Getting Clearer

The future of AppSec is in a challenging place, as teams are still dealing with old challenges, but the way developers work is changing on a near-daily basis with AI-assisted coding. There are currently three general approaches in the market:

1. Companies going all-in on AI and vibe coding: Using large language models (LLMs) for static analysis, Model Context Protocol (MCP) detection and security, and vibe coding security. It’s clear to teams that AI code adoption is here to stay, and getting ahead of it is smart.
2. Mid-market application security posture management (ASPM): This provides a ton of all-in-one scanning value for teams looking to maximize their compliance checkmarks.
3. Enterprise ASPM: This is about providing context to application security teams to remediate their code findings. The code scanners are sometimes used, but aren’t the focus of the evaluation.

For now, there’s still a basic truth to how application security works; finding true positives is the most valuable feature a tool can have. While some AI-centered solutions are promising in demos, like elsewhere, the value can be hard to prove as teams end up running a combination of scanning solutions.

## 5: Agentic AI Security Is Whatever You Say It Is

Every vendor suddenly finds themselves to be an AI-native agentic AI security platform. Navigating what AI security actually means and which tools are doing it well remains a massive challenge, as every investor and executive is pushing the message before the substance. That said, there are a few things worth noticing:

1. How to secure AI is the wild west from the standpoint of technical approaches. (See a full breakdown in our [AI Security Report](https://pulse.latio.tech/p/2025-latio-ai-security-report).)
2. Generally, incumbent vendors are focusing on basic visibility capabilities, while startups are offering governance and runtime protection for employees or first-party applications.
3. Most vendors are seeking to be “trusted partners” for AI adoption, rather than offering any specific set of meaningful capabilities.

The amount of AI risk you have depends heavily on how you’re using it. AI chatbots provide almost zero risk, but the second you wire agents up to production data, the risk profile of your application explodes. The kind of security solution you’ll be looking for depends on which of these types of architectures you’re investing in — and currently, architectures are highly divergent in terms of what’s needed for optimized protection.

BlackHat and Defcon 2025 highlighted that while innovation and AI-driven features are top of mind, practitioners must look past the noise, validate what works and focus on tools that truly reduce risk.

From the evolution of vulnerability management and renewed focus on the SOC, to the divide in application security approaches and the added layers of runtime visibility, one theme is clear: The requirements of cybersecurity are shifting rapidly, but the fundamentals still matter. Even if they don’t bring the VC-hype curb appeal.

At the end of the day, progress in cybersecurity is measured by practical tools that reduce risk and make defenders’ jobs easier.
