Cybersecurity [spending continues to rise](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-08-28-gartner-forecasts-global-information-security-spending-to-grow-15-percent-in-2025), but so do the [number of compromises](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ITRC_2023-Annual-Data-Breach-Report.pdf). The question is: If organizations are implementing more cybersecurity practices, why are the number of attacks rising?

The primary reason is that organizations are still using outdated security practices, such as security through obscurity. With the [growing complexity of cyberthreats](https://www.accuknox.com/blog/emerging-cybersecurity-threats), using only the “loose lips sink ships” method doesn’t cut it anymore.

[Open source software](https://thenewstack.io/open-source/), on the other hand, offers a proactive and transparent approach to security.
As cyber threats advance at breakneck speed, it’s important to understand the advantages of open source solutions and how they can [enhance your security posture](https://www.accuknox.com/products/cspm).

## Why Is Security by Obscurity a Thing of the Past?
Say you have $50 million cash, and you want to keep it safe. One option is to hide it in a secret spot where no one will find it… a simple concept known as “security by obscurity.”

If you’re trying to protect software rather than money, you hide your source code to maintain security and hope attackers will never be able to figure out any loopholes.

The problem is, if attackers want to figure it out, they will find a flaw they can exploit.

The US Department of Defense [states](https://dodcio.defense.gov/open-source-software-faq/#q-does-the-dod-use-oss-for-security-functions) that “security by obscurity” is not sufficient:

*“Hiding source code **does** inhibit the ability of third parties to respond to vulnerabilities (because changing software is more difficult without the source code), but this is obviously **not** a security advantage.”*
Disadvantages of this model include:

- Insiders can unintentionally leak sensitive data, posing significant security risks.
- External cheat sheets might unintentionally reveal hidden resources and vulnerabilities.
- Hackers can reverse-engineer software to find out confidential information.
- Minor breaches can expose key details of internal system architecture.
- Social engineering tactics can bypass security to access protected resources.
Relying only on obscurity gives a false sense of security, as there is no such thing as perfect obscurity. Plus, when you go all out trying to hide every detail, you’re not really addressing the underlying vulnerabilities; you’re just masking them. And you’re piling extra pressure on your IT security team. This constant focus on obscurity often leads to burnout, making it increasingly difficult to maintain a robust and responsive security posture.

## Why Is Open Source Code a Better Option?
Open source software (OSS) puts its source code out there for everyone to use, modify and improve. It is prolific in software today; [GitHub estimates](https://venturebeat.com/programming-development/github-releases-open-source-report-octoverse-2022-says-97-of-apps-use-oss/) that “open source is the foundation of 99% of the world’s software.”

Remember the example above of hiding your cash? Your second option is to use a high-security safe with a combination lock. Even if everyone knows where the safe is, they can’t get inside without the combination. Even if they get the password, you can simply change it.

Changing passwords takes much less work than moving $50 million in cash from one place to the other.

This is how security in OSS works. Even though the code is openly accessible, its security is based on layers of protection that can be easily updated and strengthened.

## Why Is Open Source Software the New Security?
Here are three reasons why open source is more secure than average closed-source software:

### Better Patch Development
With people inspecting source code regularly, there are more chances of finding an issue in the code and troubleshooting it. As [Chris Aniszczyk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caniszczyk/), CTO of the Linux Foundation, explained: *“The open source community is incredibly quick at addressing security vulnerabilities, thanks to its collaborative nature.” *In short, bugs, loopholes and flaws get fixed faster with open source.

### Always Up to Date
One of the best things about OSS is how often it gets updated. These continuous updates keep the software current, secure and equipped with the latest fixes and improvements. As [Linus Torvalds](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linustorvalds/), creator of [Linux](https://roadmap.sh/linux), put it:* “Open source is a continuous improvement process. It’s always evolving, which means security gets better over time.” *Open source software stays relevant and more effective compared to software with hidden source code.

### Community Support
Another major perk of OSS is the strong community behind it. A large group of developers and users works together to keep the software secure by sharing knowledge and addressing security concerns promptly.

[Rebecca Rumbul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-rumbul-96a5441a/), executive director of the [Rust](https://roadmap.sh/rust) Foundation, said it well: *“The power of open source comes from the community. They bring expertise and a shared interest in keeping the software secure.” *They can tackle security issues quickly, so you can trust that the software is well-protected.
### Scalability and Flexibility
OSS is highly adaptable, making it easy to scale up or down based on your needs. Whether you’re looking to expand your operations or start small, OSS offers options like clustering and load balancing to fit your requirements. This flexibility helps organizations grow efficiently while managing their resources effectively.

### Reduced Software Costs
Another significant advantage of OSS is cost savings. By opting for OSS, you can reduce expenses related to licensing and maintenance fees. This financial benefit allows organizations to allocate resources more effectively and invest in other aspects of their business.

## How Can You Use Open Source Security Effectively?
There are multiple ways industry leaders use open source security. Here are two of them:

### Making Source Code Open
Organizations can share their code so others can look at it and give feedback. By doing this, they tap into the collective expertise of the open source community.

This approach works well if the organization has the resources to manage contributions, address feedback and maintain the open source project. This includes having a team that can handle community interactions and ensure ongoing updates.

### Using Existing Open Source Software
Another smart approach is to use existing OSS. These tools come with built-in security features and are regularly updated by their communities, so they are equipped with the latest security patches and improvements. For example, tools like [KubeArmor](https://kubearmor.io) help several enterprises protect their Kubernetes environments. Similarly, [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) is another open source application used to find vulnerabilities.

Companies including Uber and Privado are already leveraging open source for security.

### Case Study 1: Uber
Uber has taken the transportation industry to the next level with its innovative app-based model offering on-demand transportation options. Anyone can get a ride by clicking a few buttons.

[Brian Hsieh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhenhsi/), Uber’s former head of open source, explained that one reason for Uber’s success was its open source community:
“*From the start, Uber has been an open source software. Establishing an open source program office was a natural and seamless step for us, as it helped us develop our platform and rapidly scale our technology. Open source is a core part of Uber’s success.*“

Hsieh also said engaging with the open source community is a huge learning opportunity for Uber’s engineers. They get to dive into new ideas and pick up valuable knowledge from experts in the community. All in all, open source has powered Uber’s growth and made its engineering culture even stronger, playing a key role in its ongoing success.

### Case Study 2: Privado
Privado is changing how privacy is managed by offering new solutions for tracking and controlling personal data. It uses real-time code scanning to monitor how personal data is handled across websites, apps and backend systems.

The company has integrated an open source tool to boost the security of its application. [Suchakra Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suchakrasharma/), chief scientist at Privado said KubeArmor adds important protection for Kubernetes environments and [compliance](https://thenewstack.io/choosing-a-grc-tool-a-4-step-roadmap) in cloud settings.

## Challenges in Open Source Security
OSS offers numerous benefits, but it also presents specific challenges. Along with developers, hackers can access and modify the code, making it easier to exploit vulnerabilities.

Moreover, reusing legacy code can introduce risks due to outdated dependencies and known flaws, which can increase vulnerabilities if not managed carefully.

Additionally, OSS licensing varies widely, and inconsistent compliance with Open Source Initiative (OSI) standards can create legal and security issues, especially when integrating different OSS components.

Despite these challenges, OSS remains a valuable choice for its flexibility and cost benefits, but it’s crucial to be aware of and address these potential pitfalls.

## Addressing Open Source Challenges
To boost your security, it’s crucial to incorporate proactive and automated measures into your cybersecurity strategy.

### Use Automation for Vulnerability Detection
Automating vulnerability detection lets you identify and fix risks faster, reducing your exposure. With automated tools, you can continuously scan your code, apps and infrastructure to catch potential weaknesses before they’re exploited.

### Stay Updated with Security Patches
Keep your systems secure by quickly applying security patches from open source projects as new vulnerabilities are discovered. This ensures your defenses are always current.

### Implement Zero Trust Security Models
Adopting a [zero-trust approach](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-reliability-requires-runtime-security-zero-trust/) means constantly verifying and authenticating every access request, providing a strong defense against vulnerabilities.

Tools like [AccuKnox CNAPP](https://www.accuknox.com/products/cnapp) make this easy by offering automated vulnerability detection, continuous patch management and a solid zero trust security framework.

### Choose Secure Open Source Tools
Yes, open source code is more secure than the “security by obscurity” method. But not all OSS is secure; some are less reliable and may have vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited if they aren’t managed.

Here are a few open source tools you can always rely on for security:

**TCP/IP:**This essential networking protocol helps manage how data travels across the internet, making sure it gets where it needs to go securely.**Linux:**A popular operating system known for being secure and flexible; it’s a great choice for running servers and managing systems safely.**KubeArmor:**This security engine works with Kubernetes to monitor and protect your applications in real time, keeping threats at bay.**MySQL:**A trusted database system that securely stores and manages your data, helping keep it safe from unauthorized access.**Kafka:**This platform handles real-time data streaming with reliability and security, making sure data flows smoothly and safely.
### Evaluate Reused Code and Third-Party Components
Before integrating reused code or third-party components, use static analysis tools to perform detailed security checks and ensure they meet quality standards.

### Cross-Train Developers and Security Teams
Equip developers with cybersecurity training and involve security experts early on to identify and address potential threats effectively.

## Conclusion
Certain systems are too critical to rely on just one security practice. Sometimes, you need to implement every trick in the book. This is why security through obscurity is no longer enough to protect your organization.

True protection comes from layered, proactive strategies like strong encryption, strict access controls, consistent patching and vigilant monitoring. Open source solutions offer transparency and continuous improvement, making them a vital part of a robust security strategy.

Want to safeguard your organization from emerging threats? It’s time to adopt a robust security strategy.
