There is a general feeling in government cybersecurity circles such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that a cryptographically relevant quantum computer could be available as early as 2035, and possibly sooner.

With the advent of quantum computing looming closer, your current security measures may already be at risk. Failing to adapt now could leave your critical infrastructure trapped in the crypto tar pit, where outdated encryption methods become liabilities instead of safeguards.

The clock is ticking, and organizations must prepare to transition to [quantum-resistant cryptography](https://thenewstack.io/nist-secures-encryption-for-a-time-after-classical-computing/) or risk being caught completely unprepared.

Don’t panic just yet. There’s a way out. Here are five key factors to consider before the tar starts pulling you under:

**1. Transition to Quantum-Resistant Algorithms**
The cryptographic algorithms we rely on today, like [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) and [ECC](https://www.vmware.com/topics/elliptic-curve-cryptography) (elliptic curve cryptography), will be powerless against quantum computing. NIST is urging a complete transition to quantum-resistant algorithms. And when quantum computers start to emerge, don’t expect a friendly heads-up before attackers begin cracking your keys. Ten years may seem far off, but it’s closer than you think.

**What this means for you**: Even though quantum computers aren’t here yet, attackers can intercept and store your encrypted data now, waiting for the day they have the power to decrypt it. If your information requires long-term security, your data could already be at risk. The [threat is real](https://thenewstack.io/real-time-sbom-focuses-supply-chain-security-on-real-threats/), and the time to act is now.
**2. Crypto-Agility: The Non-Negotiable**
Crypto-agility is your golden ticket to future-proof security. Every system you design moving forward must support the seamless switching of algorithms and cryptographic formats. Just like you don’t hang onto outdated technology, you shouldn’t cling to inflexible cryptographic methods.

Your system needs to be as nimble as a gymnast when flipping between old standards and quantum-resistant cryptography. Likewise, there is a lot of active research still going on in quantum-resistant algorithms, so as much as you do not want to get stuck in the past, there is plenty of the future that we will still need to adapt to.

**3. Plan Your Great Escape: Algorithmic Changeover**
You can’t just flip a switch on New Year’s Eve 2029 (NIST and Homeland Security expect everyone to be targeting 2030 to be quantum-ready) and expect your systems to magically support quantum-resistant cryptography.

You need to start planning now. Think of this as your cryptographic [disaster recovery plan](https://thenewstack.io/supercharge-your-disaster-recovery-plan-in-5-simple-steps/). Identify which systems are most at risk, prioritize them, build a safe migration strategy to stay crypto-agile and start rolling out updates. The quantum threat is serious, but with enough lead time, you can avoid a panic-driven, last-minute scramble.

**4. Harden Your Software Supply Chain**
Protecting your data from quantum-based attacks does not just involve updating your applications; attacks may occur anywhere along your [software supply chain](https://thenewstack.io/are-we-thinking-about-supply-chain-security-all-wrong/). From code repositories to third-party integrations, every link in the chain could become a vulnerability.

Start today. Secure your software supply chain by making use of software supply chain security practices and ensure your suppliers also understand the need to move to quantum-safe algorithms. Quantum-resistant cryptography must be applied to every layer of your development process, ensuring that both your code and the systems it interacts with are secure.

**5. If You’re Also a Manufacturer, Firmware Is Your Future**
For hardware builders, quantum-resistant firmware signing is a must — it’s the digital duct tape keeping your security intact. Without it, your devices could quickly turn into a hacker’s playground, and trust me, that’s one sandbox you don’t want to be in.

Beyond that, securing device identities and roots of trust is crucial. Every part of your digital infrastructure needs to be prepped for the quantum leap to stay ahead of future threats.

## The Bottom Line
Start now. The tar pit is not the place you want to be stuck in when quantum computing finally arrives.

Several governments have already started to mandate a move toward quantum-resistant cryptography. Final deadlines for the retirement of RSA, [Diffie-Hellman](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Diffie-Hellman-key-exchange), and elliptic curve-based encryption will be announced soon. Meeting these demands means transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptography, ensuring your future by incorporating crypto-agility, securing your software supply chain, and upgrading your infrastructure.
