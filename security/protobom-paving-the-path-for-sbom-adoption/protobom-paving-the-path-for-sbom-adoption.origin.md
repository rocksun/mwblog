The federal government and the
[Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)](https://openssf.org/) are rolling out an open source tool they hope will make it easier for the private sector and government agencies to adopt and use [software bills-of-materials](https://thenewstack.io/one-click-sbom-for-your-kubernetes-clusters-with-palette/) (SBOMs), a key component in pushing back against the rising tide of software supply chain attacks.
Pressure by the Biden Administration in the wake of the high-profile
[hack on SolarWinds](https://thenewstack.io/lessons-learned-from-2021-software-supply-chain-attacks/) in 2020 — including through its 2021 Cybersecurity Executive Order — the dangerous vulnerability in the [Apache Log4j logging tool](https://thenewstack.io/log4j-why-organizations-are-failing-to-remediate-this-risk/) a year later, and the massive exploit of [Progress Software’s MOVEit](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/progress-software-moveit-meltdown/703659/) file transfer tool last year has helped accelerate the enterprise embrace of SBOMs, with three-quarters of organizations in both the United States and UK since implementing them, according to a [report by Sonatype](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/white-paper-2023-sbom-survey-report), a supply chain optimization software vendor.
In addition, 92% of large enterprises adopted SBOMs or plan to, the report found.
It’s also fueled efforts by IT vendors to roll out myriad SBOM data formats and identification schemes, creating a fragmented market that makes it difficult for organizations to sort through all their options, according to OpenSSF, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and an office within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
## Introducing Protobom
The three organizations — which include DHS’ Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) — this week
[launched Protobom](https://openssf.org/press-release/2024/04/16/cisa-dhs-st-and-openssf-announce-global-launch-of-software-supply-chain-open-source-project/), an open source offering that can be integrated into commercial and open source applications to enable system administrators and developers to more easily and cheaply generate, read, and translate SBOMs in multiple data formats.
Protobom’s capability to manage various data formats helps drive interoperability, and the integration features mean that applications can link SBOM information with external information about software security vulnerabilities and severity data from multiple public sources, giving users access to real-time information about patches and mitigation strategies, the organizations said.
Protobom will be hosted by OpenSSF.
“Protobom not only simplifies SBOM creation but also empowers organizations to proactively manage the risk of their open source dependencies,”
[Omkhar Arasaratnam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omkhar/), general manager of OpenSSF, said in a statement. “The security of open source software requires a partnership between the public sector, private sector and the community.” [Allan Friedman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanafriedman/), CISA senior advisor and strategist, called software vulnerabilities a key risk to be exploited by bad actors.
“By leveraging SBOMs as key elements of software security, we can mitigate the risk to the software supply chain and respond to new risks faster, and more efficiently,” Friedman said in a statement. “Protobom is a step towards greater efficiency and interoperability by translating across the widely used formats so that tools and organizations can focus on what’s important.”
Both the federal government and OpenSSF have pushed the adoption of SBOMs. OpenSSF two years ago released its “
[Open Source Software Mobilization Plan](https://8112310.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/8112310/OpenSSF/OSS%20Mobilization%20Plan.pdf?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fopenssf.org%2F),” with [one of its 10 action items](https://thenewstack.io/sbom-everywhere-the-openssf-plan-for-sboms/) titled “SBOMs Everywhere.” Central to the plan is having OSS projects provide accurate SBOMs to users with each release of their software.
Protobom came out of a
[collaboration program](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2023/04/27/st-forms-new-startup-cohort-strengthen-software-supply-chain-visibility-tools) CISA and DHS funded last year that included seven startups, such as [Chainguard](https://www.chainguard.dev/?utm_content=inline+mention), AppCensus, Manifest Cyber, and Scribe Security. [Melissa Oh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissa-oh/), SVIP managing director of the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), said at the time that “DHS is tapping into the startup community to develop technology that will shine a light on risks within supply chains and bolster the overall cybersecurity of organizations.”
## Risks in a Changing Development Space
The rapid evolution in the software development field is driving the need for SBOMs and other tools for protecting the supply chain. Developers are growing their use of open source software and reusable software components and using contributions from multiple sources. In addition, the release tempo for code is accelerating and
[continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)](https://thenewstack.io/ci-cd/) pipelines are adding to the growing complexity of software development.
These factors also make the software supply chain an attractive target for threat groups. According to Sonatype’s report, such attacks grew an average of 742% each year between 2019 and 2023.
[John Bambenek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnbambenek/), president of Bambenek Consulting, told The New Stack that SBOMs are an “important piece of the puzzle” when it comes to protecting the software supply chain. If security teams don’t know they have a vulnerability, they can’t protect against the threat.
“The key to getting organizations to [use SBOMs] is giving them the tools to make it easy to create an SBOM in a normalized format so vulnerability management tools can ingest it so security teams can take appropriate actions,” he said.
However, the U.S. government being the key driver behind the Protobom effort could make it more difficult for it to be adopted globally.
“Other parts of the world tend to react with skepticism whenever the United States government is pushing agenda,” Bambenek said. “The skepticism is not entirely without cause either. For instance, it’s hard to see that countries that have an antagonistic view of the United States would be willing to adopt these tools and programs.”
That said, Sonatype researchers noted in their report that incidents such as those involving SolarWinds and Log4j – and likely the Biden Administration’s reaction – may have pushed other, friendly countries to react, noting the European Union’s announcement of its proposed Cyber Resilience Act in 2022 and the UK a year later publishing its “Call for Views on Software Resilience and Security for Businesses and Organizations.
Both actions put an emphasis on SBOMs as well as other supply chain security practices, they wrote.
