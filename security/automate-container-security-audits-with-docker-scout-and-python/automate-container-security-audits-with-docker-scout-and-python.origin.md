Security auditing is necessary in containerized application management. However, audits done manually can take a lot of time, are inconsistent, and are prone to errors. Automating the process ensures a preemptive approach to security, whereby teams can detect and resolve vulnerabilities promptly.

Docker Scout [performs automated container security](https://thenewstack.io/docker-and-chainguard-join-forces-to-deliver-secure-containers/) analysis. It automatically analyzes images for vulnerabilities and recommends remedial actions. When combined with Python, security teams can automate scans, process results, and publish them to CI/CD pipelines and dashboards.

In this article, you will learn how to:

- Set up Docker Scout for automation.
- Use Python to initiate scans and result parsing.
- Integrate automated security audits into CI/CD workflows.
- Create a security dashboard with Python.
- Follow best practices for automated security audits.
## Setting up Docker Scout for Automation
To begin automating security audits, install and configure Docker Scout.

### Install Docker Scout
Docker Scout is a built-in feature of Docker Desktop and Docker CLI. It helps in analyzing [container images for security](https://thenewstack.io/container-security-a-troubling-tale-but-hope-on-the-horizon/) problems. For optimal performance, install the latest version by running the following command:

1 |
docker scout update |
If you donâ€™t have Docker installed, simply download it and install it on your desktop. Then set up Docker CLI on your system.
### Run a Manual Vulnerability Scan
Knowing how to manually run the scans before automating them is important. You can use the command below to analyze a container image:

1 |
docker scout quickview my-image:latest |
This command inspects the container image my-image:latest and provides a security report listing vulnerabilities found within the image.
### Understand the Output
A report will be generated when the scan is complete. It will include:

- Common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs)
- Severity levels
- Recommended actions: Proposals meant for correcting or reducing issues are offered.
- JSON output: Results can be offered in automated form using JSON markup language.
To get structured JSON output, run:

1 |
docker scout quickview my-image:latest --format json > scan_results.json |
Example output:
1234567891011121314 |
{ "findings": [ { "id": "CVE-2023-12345", "severity": "HIGH", "description": "Buer overow vulnerability in XYZ package.", "fixAvailable": true }, { "id": "CVE-2023-67890", "severity": "LOW", "description": "Deprecated function usage in ABC package.", "fixAvailable": false } ] } |
This output is crucial for automation, allowing Python scripts to parse and process security data effectively.
## Using Python To Automate Docker Scout Scans
You can use Python to trigger Docker Scout scans and process results programmatically.

### Run a Docker Scout Scan From Python
1234567 |
import subprocess import json def run_scan(image_name): command = ["docker", "scout", "quickview", image_name, "--format", "json"] result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True) return json.loads(result.stdout) image = "my-image:latest" scan_results = run_scan(image) print(json.dumps(scan_results, indent=4)) |
### Extract Security Insights
1234567891011 |
def extract_vulnerabilities(scan_results): vulnerabilities = [] for finding in scan_results.get("findings", []): vulnerabilities.append({ "id": finding["id"], "severity": finding["severity"], "description": finding["description"] }) return vulnerabilitiessecurity_issues = extract_vulnerabilities(scan_results) print(security_issues) |
### Generate a Security Report
12 |
with open("security_report.json", "w") as report_file: json.dump(security_issues, report_file, indent=4) |
## Integrating Docker Scout With CI/CD Pipelines Using Python
Automating security scans within CI/CD pipelines improves DevSecOps practices.

### Automate Scans in GitHub Actions
123456789 |
jobs: security_scan: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout Code uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Run Docker Scout Scan run: | docker scout quickview my-image:latest --format json > scan_results.json |
### Trigger Scans and Report Vulnerabilities With Python
1234567891011 |
import smtplib from email.mime.text import MIMEText def send_email_report(issues): msg = MIMEText(json.dumps(issues, indent=4)) msg["Subject"] = "Docker Scout Security Scan Report" msg["From"] = "security@company.com" msg["To"] = "devops@company.com" with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.example.com") as server: server.sendmail(msg["From"], [msg["To"]], msg.as_string()) send_email_report(security_issues) |
### Send Alerts to Slack
123456 |
import requestsdef send_slack_alert(issues): webhook_url = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX" payload = {"text": f"Security Issues Found: {json.dumps(issues, indent=4)}"} requests.post(webhook_url, json=payload) send_slack_alert(security_issues) |
## Building a Python-Based Security Dashboard for Docker Scout
A web-based security dashboard provides DevOps teams with an interactive way to monitor real-time vulnerabilities.

### Using Flask/Django To Visualize Scan Results
Flask and Django allow us to build web applications. Flask normally displays security reports. It is lightweight and suitable for simple dashboards, while Django is more feature-rich for sophisticated applications.

Example Flask setup:

12345678910111213 |
from ask import Flask, jsonify import json app = Flask(__name__)@app.route("/scan_results") def get_scan_results(): with open("security_report.json") as f: data = json.load(f) return jsonify(data) if __name__ == "__main__": app.run(debug=True) |
## Creating an Interactive Dashboard for DevOps Teams
- Use JavaScript libraries like Chart.js or DataTables.js to increase visualization.
- Implement filtering, sorting, and search functionality for better analysis.
- Integrate role-based access control (RBAC) for safer access to the dashboard.
### Real-Time Vulnerability Monitoring With Python and Docker Scout
- Schedule periodic scans using cron jobs. Or, you can employ a background task queue (e.g., Celery for Django or APScheduler for Flask).
- Store scan results in a
[database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-plan-your-mongodb-upgrade/). - Trigger alerts when new issues are detected, integrating with Slack, email, or logging platforms.
## Best Practices for Automating Security Audits
Here are the best ways to automate security audits:

-
### Schedule Regular Security Checks
Implement automated security scans with a defined frequency. Set up cron jobs, task schedulers, or CI/CD pipelines to run daily and weekly scans. Regular scans make it easier to identify security holes earlier and ensure the images are current.

Example ([Linux Cron Job for Automated Scans)](https://thenewstack.io/linux-how-to-use-cron-to-schedule-jobs/):

1 |
0 2 * * * docker scout quickview my-image:latest --format json > /var/reports/security_scan.json |
This scan is run every day at 2 a.m. and saves the results.
-
### Integrate Findings Into Vulnerability Management Workflows
Security breaches must not remain unattended. Integrate the scan outcomes with issue-tracking platforms such as Jira or ServiceNow so vulnerabilities are assigned, monitoring is in place, and resolution is administered promptly.

Example (Python Integration with Jira):

123456789101112 |
from jira import JIRA def create_jira_ticket(issue): jira = JIRA("https://your-jira-instance.com", auth=("user", "password")) new_issue = jira.create_issue( project="SEC", summary=f"Security Issue: {issue['id']}", description=f"Severity: {issue['severity']}\nDetails: {issue['description']}", issuetype={"name": "Bug"} ) return new_issue.key for issue in security_issues: create_jira_ticket(issue) |
The above command allows you to verify that security vulnerabilities are managed effectively within existing workflows.
-
### Ensure Compliance with Security Policies
Security scans need to meet compliance requirements and be vetted by officials. These may include, but are not limited to, CIS benchmarks, NIST, or PCI-DSS standards. Policy rule definitions and tagging the image as noncompliant should automate compliance verification.

Example (Docker Scout Policy Enforcement):

1 |
docker scout policy evaluate my-image:latest --policy my-security-policy.json This enforces predefined security policies and ensures compliance. |
-
### Set Up Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts
Set up configuration for real-time identification to detect emerging threats. Use logs and metrics visualisation tools like Splunk, ELK Stack, or Prometheus to monitor and visualize security data.

Example (Sending logs to ELK Stack with Filebeat):

123456 |
filebeat. inputs: - type: log paths: - /var/reports/security_scan.json output.elasticsearch: hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"] |
This setup ensures that security findings are logged and monitored continuously.
## Final Thoughts
Docker Scout, integrated with Python, can automate container security audits. It optimizes DevSecOps culture and alleviates manual effort and the process of managing vulnerabilities. [Python allows developers to automate](https://thenewstack.io/pythons-automation-magic/) scans and result evaluations and integrate security workers, which maximizes efficiency.

In the future, the automation of security processes driven by AI technology can improve vulnerability detection and fixing even more. Following these best practices ensures container security and allows companies to remain proactive regarding new threats.
