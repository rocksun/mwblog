Over the past month, the open source community has been abuzz with discussions surrounding the
[XZ security incident](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/2/24119342/xz-utils-linux-backdoor-attempt). The incident, which involved a sophisticated attack on the XZ compression library, has highlighted the urgent need for [improved security measures](https://thenewstack.io/unzipping-the-xz-backdoor-and-its-lessons-for-open-source/) and trust mechanisms within the open source software ecosystem.
According to reports, an individual operating under the pseudonym “Jia Tan” offered assistance to a busy maintainer of the
[XZ library](https://thenewstack.io/malicious-code-in-linux-xz-libraries-endangers-ssh/) over a two-year period. The maintainer, a respected and longstanding contributor to the Linux community, eventually granted Jia commit access and [maintainership of XZ](https://thenewstack.io/linux-xz-backdoor-damage-could-be-greater-than-feared/). Additionally, several other people or aliases emerged to support Jia by exerting pressure on the original maintainer to expedite the implementation of fixes.
Once Jia had secured control over the library repositories, a meticulously concealed backdoor was discreetly introduced into liblzma, a dependency of OpenSSH on various Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora. This backdoor, embedded within the compression library, monitors for specific commands sent by an attacker at the commencement of an SSH session, potentially enabling unauthorized remote code execution on the compromised system without necessitating a login.
## The Three Big Questions for Better OSS Security
The discovery of the backdoor can be attributed to the
[vigilance of Andres Freund](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/discovering-the-xz-backdoor-with-andres-freund/id1625932222?i=1000652031933), a lead maintainer of the PostgreSQL project, who detected anomalies in the form of bugs and elevated CPU consumption while benchmarking SSH. Freund’s timely detection serves as a powerful validation of the “all bugs are shallow” principle upheld by the open source community in the context of security. Had this vulnerability existed within closed source software, the likelihood of its discovery would have been significantly diminished.
The timely detection serves as a powerful validation of the ‘all bugs are shallow’ principle upheld by the open source community in the context of security.
Nevertheless, the XZ incident underscores a fundamental reality that demands the attention of the open source community and the broader software industry. To enhance the security of the open source software ecosystem, three critical questions must be addressed:
- What constitutes the most critical software?
- Who created that software, and can they be trusted?
- Is the code they developed secure?
The ongoing and rapid adoption of software bill of materials (SBOM) will ultimately provide us with tools to analyze and constantly update software criticality. At scale, SBOMs will deliver a comprehensive census that can accurately determine software criticality by allowing us to measure in aggregate software usage as well as its functional role. A new piece that enables normalization of SBOMs across standards, called
[Protobom](https://thenewstack.io/protobom-paving-the-path-for-sbom-adoption/), just landed courtesy of CISA (Cybersecurity and infrastructure Security Agency), DHS and OpenSSF, resolving the compatibility issues that have to date been a significant challenge.
Regarding code security, organizations like CISA, MITRE, the OpenSSF and other community stakeholders have implemented various initiatives to improve code security verification. These measures include offering free fuzzing services for open source projects, expanding the availability of security scanning tools and advocating for the rewriting of critical software using memory-safe languages such as Rust and Golang.
## A Systematic Approach to Trust for OSS
In the XZ situation, the problem is trust. The open and democratic nature of open source development allows anyone, regardless of background, to contribute to any project at any time. While this inclusivity is commendable, the absence of a reliable mechanism to assess the trustworthiness of new contributors poses a significant risk. The community currently lacks a reputation system that could flag individuals like Jia Tan, who possess no prior record of engagement, as potentially suspicious and warranting closer scrutiny of their contributions.
While reputation systems are not infallible, implementing them would make it more challenging for malicious actors to infiltrate and compromise the open source ecosystem.
It is crucial to emphasize that a reputation system would not aim to ostracize or diminish anonymous participation in the community. Anonymity and trust are not mutually exclusive, provided that the individual has established a track record and reputation through previous interactions and contributions. There are and will be longtime anonymous contributors who prove their worth through time, by constantly showing up in listservs, pull requests and other community forums for discussion and debate. Their contributions can be vetted but over time, of course, and they will accrue more trust.
A shortcut to trust is a reputation system. While reputation systems are not infallible, implementing them would make it more challenging for malicious actors to infiltrate and compromise the open source ecosystem. Many online game communities have done this, either overtly or as part of automated moderation systems. Uber and Lyft have reputation systems for their drivers. It is part of the fabric of the technology universe and when it works, reputation becomes a good proxy for trust.
To be clear, trust and security, although correlated, are distinct concepts. Trust alone does not guarantee security; any code, regardless of its author, should undergo the same rigorous and objective security analysis. Trust becomes relevant when assigning roles, such as maintainership, that involve making judgments about the intent behind code changes. In the case of Jia, these intentions were malicious.
As the XZ attack starkly demonstrates, the absence of a robust reputational framework leaves open source software vulnerable to significant risks. To effectively secure the software supply chain, the open source community must prioritize the development and deployment of a comprehensive system of reputational metrics. Such a system would empower maintainers tasked with safeguarding critical software to make informed decisions about whom to trust. It would also make it transparent to the community whether someone proposing code deserves the benefit of the doubt or whether their code should be given greater scrutiny. Enabling a reputation metric that is common across open source will fortify the integrity of the software development process and make us all more secure.
