[InfoBlip Shift software development conference](https://shift.infobip.com/us/), being held this week in Miami.
Modern software development relies heavily on a complex web of interconnected components, including libraries, frameworks, and various dependencies. This intricate ecosystem, known as the software supply chain, has grown significantly in recent years. As a result, it has become crucial for developers and organizations to thoroughly understand and effectively
[manage the numerous relationships and dependencies](https://thenewstack.io/automated-dependency-management-with-depfu/) within their software projects to ensure stability, security, and maintainability.
With organizations heavily relying on open-source components and diverse ecosystems to construct their applications, the threat of supply chain attacks has surged. These attacks, orchestrated by malicious actors who exploit vulnerabilities in these dependencies, can compromise entire downstream ecosystems, leading to substantial financial losses and irreparable damage to reputation.
According to
[ Cybersecurity Ventures](https://cybersecurityventures.com/software-supply-chain-attacks-to-cost-the-world-60-billion-by-2025/), the global cost of software supply chain attacks on businesses is predicted to reach a staggering **$138 billion by 2031**. This alarming statistic underscores the critical importance of proactively addressing [software supply chain security](https://thenewstack.io/linux-foundations-sigstore-aims-to-more-easily-secure-software-supply-chains/) risks. Organizations must prioritize the integrity and resilience of their software supply chains to protect their digital assets and mitigate potential threats.
Centralizing the management of development environments, whether they are local, remote, or a combination of both (hybrid), can be an effective approach to addressing the intricacies of this challenge. This centralized management strategy offers a range of advantages that can streamline the
[development process and improve overall efficiency](https://thenewstack.io/mature-cloud-native-security-improves-developer-efficiency/).
[‘Open source software]doesn’t just fuel innovation across industries, from satellites to cars to banks and whole institutions. It also underpins national security and critical infrastructure like water, energy, and manufacturing.’ — [Jim Zemlin], Executive Director of The Linux Foundation
By centralizing development environments and prioritizing
[supply chain security](https://thenewstack.io/chainguard-a-zero-trust-supply-chain-security-company/), we can ensure that the foundation of our digital world remains strong, resilient, and trustworthy.
## Understanding the Software Supply Chain
To appreciate the significance of development environments management centralization for source code security, it’s essential to understand the intricacies of the software supply chain. The
[software supply chain](https://thenewstack.io/securing-the-software-supply-chain-with-slsa/) encompasses all the interconnected modules and components involved in the development and deployment. This includes code, configurations, proprietary and open source libraries, plugins, container dependencies, and the tools and people involved in software development.
‘90% of the code originates from open source dependencies, while the remaining 10% is written by your development team.’
— [Feross Aboukhadijeh], Founder and CEO of Socket
The complexity of today’s software supply chains, which often rely on diverse software and online services ecosystems, makes them particularly vulnerable to attacks. Vulnerabilities can stem from various sources, including infrastructure misconfigurations, exploitation of software vulnerabilities, outdated code components, and human error. As a result, organizations must adopt a comprehensive approach to
[secure their software supply chains](https://thenewstack.io/codenotary-cloud-secures-software-supply-chain-and-devsecops/) effectively.
‘The rapidly rising frequency of software supply chain attacks is a stark reality. It’s more crucial than ever for organizations to prioritize software supply chain security —
beforea link in part of their supply chain gets compromised.’ [Software supply chain security](https://thenewstack.io/software-supply-chain-security-tearing-down-the-silos/) involves identifying and mitigating risks associated with the technologies and methodologies utilized throughout the software development lifecycle. This encompasses the entire journey from creation to deployment, covering aspects like open source dependencies, development and testing tools, package managers, and more.
Unlike traditional cyberthreats, supply chain vulnerabilities pose a unique danger as a single compromise can affect a broad range of end-users and systems, making detection particularly challenging.
Notable instances of software supply chain breaches include:
**Event-stream Incident:**The npm package, [event-stream](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180565383195/details-about-the-event-stream-incident), was infiltrated after a maintainer introduced a harmful dependency, flatMap Stream, which, when updated, would incorporate the malevolent code into the package. **SolarWinds Orion Breach:**Attackers infiltrated the [SolarWinds Orion Platform](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/SolarWinds-hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know), a widely used infrastructure monitoring system, misleading users to download a compromised update. This breach affected major corporations and government entities by exploiting the platform’s trusted status. **Codecov Bash Uploader Compromise:** [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/security-update/)fell victim to a security breach when attackers exploited Docker image creation flaws to access credentials, altering the installation script and documentation, which affected numerous clients, including Twilio and GoDaddy.
These incidents highlight the vulnerability of software supply chains, where a single compromised element can have widespread repercussions. The rising concern over such breaches, amplified by regulatory responses like the
[ Biden Administration’s Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/), has driven organizations to emphasize software supply chain security measures.
## The Benefits of Dev Environments Centralization
Centralizing source code interactions in self-managed dev environments offers several compelling benefits that directly address the challenges of scattered code management and enhance supply chain security.
Firstly, it
**enhances security and compliance** by consolidating code repositories in a single, cloud-based platform. This allows organizations to gain better control over access permissions and enforce consistent security policies across the entire codebase. Centralized environments can be configured to comply with industry standards and regulations automatically, reducing the risk of breaches that could disrupt the supply chain. As Jen Easterly, Director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), emphasizes, centralizing source code in the cloud aligns with the goal of working with the open source community to ensure secure software while reaping its benefits.
Secondly, cloud-based centralization fosters
**improved collaboration and efficiency** among development teams. With a centralized platform, teams can collaborate in real-time, regardless of their geographical location, facilitating faster decision-making and problem-solving. Cloud environments enable streamlined workflows by integrating with other development tools, such as CI/CD pipelines, testing environments, and deployment platforms, allowing for automated and efficient processes.
Thirdly, centralized cloud environments offer
**enhanced reliability and disaster recovery** capabilities. Cloud providers typically replicate data across multiple locations, ensuring that a failure in one area does not result in data loss. This is critical for maintaining the [software supply chain’s integrity](https://thenewstack.io/software-supply-chain-secure-3/). In the event of a disaster or outage, cloud environments can rapidly restore data and services, minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity.
Furthermore, centralization provides organizations the
**scalability and flexibility** to adapt to changing requirements and market demands. Cloud environments can dynamically scale resources based on the development team’s needs, ensuring supply chain systems remain responsive and performant. The cloud also offers various tools and services that development teams can leverage to address emerging supply chain challenges without significant upfront investments or lengthy deployment times.
Lastly, centralizing source code in the
[cloud can lead to ](https://thenewstack.io/want-to-save-the-world-start-by-cutting-your-cloud-costs/) **cost savings** for organizations. Cloud services typically operate on a pay-as-you-go model, eliminating the need for upfront capital investments and ongoing maintenance costs associated with on-premises infrastructure.
While dev environments management centralization offers numerous benefits, it’s important to acknowledge and address potential concerns and challenges, such as data privacy, vendor lock-in, and migration challenges. Organizations must consider using open standards and portable technologies to minimize the risk of vendor lock-in and plan their migrations carefully to ensure a smooth transition without impacting development workflows.
