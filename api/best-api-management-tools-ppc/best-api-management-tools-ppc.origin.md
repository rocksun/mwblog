## Looking for the Best API Management platform and a top API Management tools comparison?
You've probably landed on this page because you've searched for either the "Best API Gateway," the "Best API Management platform," the "Best API Management tools," "top api management tools", or something like that. Unfortunately, when you search for this, you typically get a list of vendor comparison pages (And, yes, [we've written our own](/comparison/gravitee-vs-apigee-0)...but we think we've done something pretty unique with ours, so definitely check them out!), and these are often incredibly biased. For example, we often see that vendors, when comparing themselves against other vendors, give themselves a checkmark in every box, and the competitor hardly has any checkboxes.

And that's simply not helpful for an evaluating team like yours. It's also not honest, and it doesn't convey the truth of the matter: the best api management platform is dependent on your use case and needs...and, yes, this logic applies to Gravitee as an api management solutions provider as well.

So, we've done a few things that we hope help:

- We've written in-depth feature comparisons for each top api management tool. This doesn't just mean us looking at
[Gravitee](/comparison/gravitee-vs-kong)vs. Kong, for example, but also us comparing[Kong to Apigee](/comparison/kong-vs-apigee),[Tyk](/comparison/kong-vs-tyk), and so on. And we do this for most of the major best api management tools. Why do we do this? When you're searching for the best API Management platform, you might end up being between Kong and Tyk, and perhaps you want a third party (i.e., not Kong or Tyk) to give you their opinion. - We've written this blog as a centralized location for our various api management solutions comparison content so that you can do your research without having to leave this page.
We hope that you find this all very helpful! If not, please do [reach out and let us know.](/contact-us) And now, on to the research!

## Ranking the best API Management platforms
Just kidding! We aren't doing a ranking because that doesn't make sense when the best api management tool is dependent on your use case. So, we've just compiled a list of the best API Management solutions and put them here in no particular order (although [we do include Gravitee ](#Gravitee), and we really do think we're at least worth a look!)

### Which API Management tools have we included in this comparison?
While there are many API Gateway and API Management solutions out there, we've narrowed our list down to 6 (and we'll be adding more over time, so keep a lookout):

- Kong
- Tyk
- Apigee
- Mulesoft
- Azure API Gateway
- AWS API Gateway
#### How we decided on this list of API Management solutions
Yes, we are certainly biased in our chosen list of solutions...they are simply the ones we hear about the most! If there are other API Management software solutions that you'd like us to [research, let us know](/contact-us)!

## Best API Management platforms: Kong API Management solutions
Kong is widely known and considered one of the premier enterprise API Gateway and API Management solutions. As we call out in our [Kong comparison pages](/comparison/gravitee-vs-kong), we feel that Kong offers a "..relatively mature enterprise Gateway and API Management solution." When looking at their strong points, their most significant (when comparing them to other API Management solutions) is their inclusion of a Service Mesh offering in their platform. If you are a team that is set on having one vendor provide an API Management tool and a Service Mesh tool, then Kong is at least worth a look. However, we understand that most organizations now looking for a Service Mesh are [beginning to standardize on Istio](https://istio.io/latest/about/service-mesh/); in other words, Istio has likely "won."

If you are like most organizations, you likely don't need a vendor that offers both a Service Mesh and an API Management solution (and perhaps you just need an API Management platform that can support your existing Service Mesh solution like Gravitee's). In that case, Kong might not be your best option. However, here is our list of pros and cons for Kong API Management:

## Pros of Kong API Management platform |
## Cons of Kong API Management platform |
An established vendor with brand recognition | Depending on which pricing and packaging tier you choose, Kong can get very expensive as you scale;
|
Offers Service Mesh in addition to API Management | Kong's focus on Service Mesh has led to less emphasis on API Management |
Offers most of what you need for basic API Management use cases | Kong does not provide robust support for exposing event and message brokers as event APIs like
|
[include IAM as a part of your API security strategy](/platform/access-management)(which we recommend), you will have to buy a separate solution, such as Okta## Top API Management tool: Tyk API Management solutions
Tyk is a newer player than Kong but has gained the attention of some, primarily due to their early adoption of services around GraphQL. For a while, Tyk was possibly the most advanced GraphQL API management solution on the market. However, [other solutions have begun to catch up](/blog/graphql-capabilities), and GraphQL really hasn't caught on as much as folks thought it might. Because of this focus, they were late to building some of the more "core" features to support OAS and, even less so, event APIs.

That said, Tyk is a modern API Management solution with a relatively robust cloud offering. You can learn more about how that cloud offering is [structured, priced, and packaged here.](/pricing/tyk-api-management) At this point, Tyk offers most of the functionality needed for a traditional API Management solution. Still, they do lack some functionality for more modern use cases, such as supporting asynchronous APIs, event APIs, and federated API Management. Here is our list of pros and cons for Tyk API Management:

## Pros of Tyk API Management platform |
## Cons of Tyk API Management platform |
A relatively established vendor with brand recognition |

[some other modern vendors do;](/platform/streaming-proxies)Although they do offer some support for Kafka use cases[include IAM as a part of your API security strategy](/platform/access-management)(which we recommend), you will have to buy a separate solution, such as Okta## Best API Management tools: Apigee API Management solutions
Apigee was a very early entrant into this space, and their early success [led to an acquisition by Google](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/google-to-acquire-apigee). This acquisition was great for the Apigee team but has generally been regarded as less than stellar for Apigee customers. We'll cover some of the typical cons of this acquisition in our pros and cons chart below.

Post-acquisition issues aside, Apigee is widely considered a suitable enterprise API Management solution. While they haven't done too much to offer new support for modern API Management use cases (such as [supporting event and message brokers](/platform/streaming-proxies)), they have specialized in creating a platform that enables you to expose, publish, and monetize API products relatively quickly. This is likely the #1 pro of choosing a solution like Apigee, although [other vendors do offer solutions for this use case as well](/blog/incentivizing-api-providers-and-consumers-through-api-monetization).

Before we jump into the pros and cons of Apigee API Management, it's essential to call out Apigee/Google's cloud strategy and how it impacts teams using and/or looking at Apigee. Apigee's newest versions, with the most modern features and innovation, require you to deploy and host Apigee in a Google Cloud environment. You cannot use another cloud provider. That said, you can use another cloud solution if using the older, outdated versions of Apigee. This has been an issue for modern teams that want to implement hybrid and multi-cloud strategies.

All of that said, let's jump into the pros and cons of Apigee API Management.


## Pros of Apigee API Management platform |
## Cons of Apigee API Management platform |
A very established vendor with brand recognition | Apigee has not innovated as quickly as some of the other, newer API Management vendors. This is especially true for the versions of Apigee that support other cloud vendors outside of GCP |
Offers relatively robust support for productizing APIs | Apigee's Developer Portal is more difficult to use and set up than many other solutions (see more details in the "API Developer Portal, API Productization, and API Monetization"

[section on this page](/comparison/gravitee-vs-apigee))[pay-as-you-go and subscription-based pricing](/pricing/apigee)might be appealing[the pricing structure might seem complex](/pricing/apigee). Apigee also penalizes teams that need support for large amounts of API consumption and, therefore can get very expensive as you scale your API initiatives[Other vendors](/api-management-buyers-guide-event-native)have blown past them here. You can find more details in the "API Gateway and API Management console" section of our[in-depth Apigee feature comparison page.](/comparison/gravitee-vs-apigee)[include IAM as a part of your API security strategy](/platform/access-management)(which we recommend), you will have to buy a separate solution, such as Okta## Best API Management platforms: AWS API Gateway
The AWS Gateway proxies traffic and can control access to your APIs. Still, you will only be able to do so by writing Lambda functions, which require particular AWS skills, or by using a limited number of settings in the API usage plan. [Their pricing has also been known to be a problem](/pricing/aws-api-gateway), as they charge almost purely based on API consumption and lambda function execution. We've helped many organizations [migrate away from AWS](/migration), saving millions of dollars per year while still getting more robust API Management support, such as a pre-built Developer Portal, [pre-built Gateway logic](/plugins) and authorization, [support for event APIs](/platform/streaming-proxies), and more.

It's also important to note that the AWS API Gateway solution only offers limited support for REST APIs, HTTP APIs, and Websocket APIs, leaving many organizations that have different APIs and protocols being used with no solution.

That said, you will get some of the basic functionality needed to start an API Management practice. Here is our list of pros and cons for AWS API Gateway:

## Pros of AWS API Management tools |
## Cons of AWS API Management tools |
Most teams are using AWS at least somewhere, and AWS makes it easy to spend credits against your AWS API Gateway solution | AWS forces you to use AWS cloud, as their primary offering is AWS-managed. For teams that want to self-host Gateways or want a hybrid deployment pattern, AWS is not recommended |
Offers some of the most basic functionality for creating API proxies | AWS does not provide a pre-built, vendor-managed
|
Because much of the Gateway logic necessary for enterprise API Management practices is tied to Lambda functions, you are forced to:

- Write these functions, which can be complex
- Pay per execution, which can get
*very*costly
[consumption-based pricing](/pricing/aws-api-gateway)might be appealingAWS API Gateway's [pay-as-you-go and consumption-based pricing ](/pricing/aws-api-gateway)is significantly limiting for organizations that want to scale while still keeping costs down. For example, We've cut costs by more than 60% for large enterprises when migrating away from AWS.

[in-depth AWS API Gateway feature comparison page](/comparison/gravitee-vs-aws).## Best API Management platforms: Azure API Management tools
Azure provides a no-frills, run-of-the-mill API Gateway and Management solution. The solution includes basic API Gateway and API Management functionality like policy configuration and application, service transformation, etc. Like other solutions offered by primarily cloud providers (think AWS Gateway), the main advantage is that you can bundle your API Management and API Gateway solution with your cloud-provisioning vendor. Personally, we often feel that this benefit is overstated, and we recommend choosing a vendor that is a true expert in API Management. That said, here are the pros and cons of choosing Azure for your API Management tooling:

## Pros of Azure API Management tools |
## Cons of Azure API Management tools |
If you're already using Azure for cloud services, you can use that spend towards Azure API Management tools | Like AWS, you're going to need to use Azure cloud services |
Offers some of the most basic functionality for creating API proxies | Azure API Gateway is not known for being feature-rich and is not recommended for more complex, modern API Management use cases. For more information, check out our
|
While Azure API Gateway tooling supports some WebSocket and GraphQL use cases, there are other modern use cases that they don't support, such as [exposing event and message broker resources as APIs](/platform/streaming-proxies)

Azure API Gateway's pay-as-you-go and consumption-based pricing is significantly limiting for organizations that want to scale while still keeping costs down.

## Best API Management platform: Gravitee
We've saved the best for last (just kidding...remember, the best is based on *your *use case)!

Gravitee is a fully-featured, full-lifecycle API Management solution. We'll leave the in-depth feature explanation to our complete guide[ to the Gravitee platform](/everything-gravitee), but here's a quick snapshot of where we feel we excel and are different than the other vendors on this page:

**We've focused on building out the most robust full-lifecycle API Management solution on the market**. For example, while we can work alongside and complement your service mesh offering, we've chosen not to build our own service mesh product, and this has allowed us to create the most robust API Management solution for every stage in the API lifecycle.**We are event-native.**This means that we offer native support not only for synchronous REST APIs but also for event APIs, exposing event and message brokers as APIs, and asynchronous APIs using the AsyncAPI spec. Nobody else offers this level of support for asynchronous and event API use cases.**We offer the most advanced security of any other API Management platform.**Because we provide dozens of[pre-built policies](/plugins)(many of them security-focused), simple[access control mechanisms via plans](https://documentation.gravitee.io/apim/guides/api-exposure-plans-applications-and-subscriptions), and a[fully-featured Identity and Access Management solution](/platform/access-management), nobody offers the amount of pre-built, vendor-managed, and "ready-to-go" API security functionality
That said, there are always cons to every solution (just like there are pros!). Here's our list:

## Pros of the Gravitee API Management platform |
## Cons of the Gravitee API Management platform |
We are totally cloud-agnostic. Deploy and host Gravitee in whatever major cloud provider you want. | We do not offer a standalone service mesh solution |
