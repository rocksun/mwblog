APIs are the lifeblood of the internet, enabling seamless communication between applications, services, and devices. With the rise of AI technologies, APIs have taken on even greater strategic importance, powering intelligent applications, large language models (LLMs), and complex ecosystems. However, this rapid evolution presents significant challenges in terms of discovery, security, standardization, and governance.

I recently had the privilege of hosting a roundtable discussion featuring panelists Joni Klippert (CEO of [StackHawk](https://www.stackhawk.com/)), Rodric Rabbah (Head of Product at [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)), and Alex Drag (Head of Product Marketing at [Kong](https://konghq.com/)). These industry leaders highlight key issues and emerging approaches that are shaping modern API management in the era of AI.

## The Challenge of API Discovery and Visibility

As APIs proliferate across organizational environments, maintaining a comprehensive and up-to-date inventory becomes increasingly challenging. Alex Drag of Kong discusses at length the challenges with wrangling APIs across multiple gateways. At the same time, Joni Klippert of StackHawk notes that security teams often overlook only a fraction of the total API landscape, exposing organizations to significant security risks due to these blind spots.

To address this, the panel emphasizes the importance of having a centralized place to discover and view APIs across an organization, including metadata such as ownership, security policies, and usage monitoring. Techniques such as code-based scanning and integrations with existing [developer tools help improve](https://thenewstack.io/gemini-code-assist-review-code-completions-need-improvement/) visibility and control, enabling organizations to keep pace with their expanding API ecosystems.

## Proactive API Security in a Complex Ecosystem

Moving from reactive to proactive security practices is also a recurring theme in the conversation. StackHawk’s focus on testing APIs during development underscores the importance of identifying vulnerabilities early. The concept of “security debt” — the accumulation of untested or insecure APIs — poses a significant threat to organizations.

Postman’s Roderick stresses the importance of continuous monitoring, scanning, and securing APIs even before deployment. Aligning developer incentives and offering clear security guidance fosters proactive behavior, reducing the risk of breaches and enhancing overall API resilience.

## Streamlining Documentation and Standardization

Keeping API documentation current and accurate remains a core challenge. Developers often view documentation as a burdensome chore, leading to gaps that can hinder security and governance. StackHawk advocates for AI-powered solutions that automatically generate API specifications from source code, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.

Another issue is a lack of standardization within organizations. Rodric Rabbah of Postman acknowledges that diversity in API gateway implementations complicates this effort, but ultimately concludes that maintaining a consistent, centralized API landscape is crucial for governance and security assurance in rapidly evolving environments.

## API Monetization and the Impact of AI

[APIs are increasingly seen as strategic](https://thenewstack.io/beyond-monitoring-the-urgent-need-for-strategic-api-consumption-management/) assets capable of generating revenue through monetization models, both internally and externally. The advent of AI and LLMs introduces new layers of [complexity and opportunity — necessitating better governance](https://thenewstack.io/kubecon-keynotes-wrestle-with-ai-governance-complexities/), security, and visibility.

Drag opens a discussion on the evolution of [API management tools](https://thenewstack.io/api-management/ "API management tools") to support emerging use cases, including API scorecards and the Model Composition Protocol (MCP). As the convergence of APIs and AI accelerates, organizations must adapt their management strategies to ensure security, cost control, and operational agility.

## Conclusion

The roundtable discussion paints a comprehensive picture of the challenges and solutions shaping modern API management. As APIs become increasingly intertwined with AI, organizations require proactive, centralized, and automated tools to discover, secure, and govern their digital assets effectively.

Vendors like Kong, Postman, and StackHawk are leading the charge from different angles, offering innovative [approaches that address the complex realities of today’s API](https://thenewstack.io/how-devsecops-teams-should-approach-api-security/) landscape. By embracing these solutions, organizations can unlock the full potential of AI-driven innovation while maintaining security, compliance, and operational efficiency.
