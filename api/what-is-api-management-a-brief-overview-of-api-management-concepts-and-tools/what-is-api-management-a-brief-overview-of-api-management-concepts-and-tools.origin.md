# 10 Best API Management Tools
by Jeremy H • August 12, 2024Modern application development and IT infrastructure depend heavily on the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and API Management. APIs offer a standard set of rules for systems and applications to connect and interact. Whether you are integrating a new application into an IT infrastructure or connecting the modular components of a microservices-based application, APIs are one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways to establish those connections.

While these advantages are clear, there is a significant *disadvantage* to APIs: The process of developing APIs and establishing and managing API connections can be tedious, time-consuming, and costly. Additionally, [over 60 percent of companies](https://salt.security/api-security-trends) experience delays in application deployment due to API security concerns.

This is where API management can help. An API manager offers a suite of API-related tools and services to dramatically alleviate the cost, time, and labor bottleneck surrounding APIs. In this guide, we will help you understand the fundamental aspects of API management and help you find the top 3 best API Management tools.

Here's the key things to know about API Management tools:

- API Management platforms simplify API development by providing a catalog of prebuilt REST APIs and tools for custom API creation, accelerating the integration of services into applications.
- The API Manager acts as a gateway between systems and APIs, handling calls, responses, and adding security, stability, and control.
- Essential components of API Management include a Developer Portal for discovering and subscribing to APIs, an API Gateway for managing interactions, and API Lifecycle Management for overseeing the entire process of API usage.
- Benefits of using API Management include building agile, loosely-coupled systems, standardizing connections across various API formats, and providing a searchable API directory for easy development.
- Advanced features include monitoring, logging, streamlined authentication, and standardizing security, making API Management a critical tool for modern businesses.
## Overview of API Management
An API Management platform eases the burden of developing custom APIs and API connections by offering developers a catalog of prebuilt REST (REpresentational State Transfer) APIs and tools for quickly developing custom APIs as required. In turn, this empowers developers to rapidly incorporate services and features into their applications and IT projects.

The API Manager functions as a gateway that sits between the system you’re developing and the API for the service you want to call. When your system connects to an API, it only calls the API manager rather than the individual APIs it needs to interact with.

The API manager handles the call to the REST API, gets the response, and returns it to your system. It also adds a layer of security, stability, and control by limiting access to the APIs in the catalog, authenticating users, monitoring for problems, query limiting, and logging data for troubleshooting.

## Key Components of API Management
An API management platform will include the following services and features at a minimum:

### 1. Developer Portal
A developer portal is a feature whereby developers can browse, discover, adopt, test, and subscribe to different APIs for a variety of applications and microservices. The developer portal puts everything you need to rapidly integrate new services at your fingertips. Things like authentication, language translations, map services, and endless other features become easy to add to your projects.

### 2. API Gateway
An API gateway mediates all of the connections and interactions between your system and the API manager’s catalog of APIs. By managing these interactions, your system only needs to call the API gateway and the gateway manages the actual communication and sends back the results.

### 3. API Lifecycle Management
API lifecycle management refers to the tools and services for creating, publishing, deploying, versioning, monitoring, discovering, and consuming custom APIs. Some API management platforms, like DreamFactory, include point-and-click API creation tools that automatically generate REST APIs from any database. These tools allow developers to create and publish custom APIs in a matter of minutes.

API lifecycle management helps the consumer of APIs as well. API management platforms facilitate API discovery and access. They also help API consumers communicate feedback and special requests to developers. Ultimately, API lifecycle management reduces the time and cost of developing, publishing, discovering, and securing custom [REST APIs](https://blog.dreamfactory.com/types-of-apis-popular-rest-api-protocol/).

## Benefits of API Management
App developers and enterprises are flocking to API management for the following key benefits:

### 1. Build an Agile, Loosely Coupled System
Since the API manager handles the connections between your system and the different APIs your system needs to use, it bypasses the need for tightly-coupled connections between the services and apps that comprise your architectural design. In this way, API management supports a more agile, flexible, and loosely-coupled architecture to achieve the following:

- Minimize the chances of coding conflicts when making upgrades
- Speeds up development and reduces time to market
- Make updates and changes faster and more cost-efficient
- Test new services/features faster and more economically
- Make managing microservice-based applications considerably easier
### 2. Standardize Connections for the Widest Variety of APIs
Whether you are developing an app that needs to call different APIs or integrating different applications into your IT infrastructure, you may be dealing with a variety of API formats and protocols. These may include any of the followings:

- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
- REST
- XML-RPC (Extensible Markup Language Remote Procedure Call)
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)-RPC
You may also need to connect with open APIs, partner APIs, and internal APIs with different authentication requirements and access restrictions. An API manager like DreamFactory automatically manages authentication and access for different types of APIs. Such a platform provides the necessary protocol and format translations to integrate the widest variety of APIs into your projects.

### 3. Put the Most Useful APIs at Your Fingertips
An API manager puts a searchable API directory at your fingertips to facilitate app development. In this way, the API manager provides a variety of readily-available services. By searching through an organized catalog, developers can quickly discover, use and reuse APIs for the services and features they want to incorporate into their projects.

### 4. Advanced Monitoring and Logging
An API manager keeps tabs on your connections through advanced monitoring features that provide detailed logging and audit trails. This helps with detecting and troubleshooting problems because you can examine the exact administrator and user actions that triggered the abnormal event or malfunction.

### 5. Streamline API Authentication
Advanced API management platforms like DreamFactory empower developers to quickly weave authentication services (like Active Directory, Okta, Google, and more) into their apps and projects. This allows you to implement role-based access controls (RBAC), manage API keys, and deploy other security features.

### 6. Standardize Security
API management makes it easier to standardize security across an enterprise IT infrastructure. The API manager ensures that all of the connections passing through it conform to SOC2 (Service Organization Control), PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and various security standards your organization might need to adhere to.

API security is a top concern for many organizations, with over [nine out of 10](https://salt.security/api-security-trends) of all companies suffering from an API security vulnerability every year. Many API management platforms optimize specifically to avoid the top security risks as summarized in the [OWASP API Security Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/).

Just a few of these include:

**Broken user authentication**. Authentication methods like RBAC are essential features for APIs, but without an API management platform, there is a stronger potential for broken or misconfigured authentication, resulting in unauthorized access.**Excessive data exposure**. The best API management platforms also provide alerts and safeguards to prevent accidental or poorly considered data exposure. The more data gets exposed, the greater the potential for losing your clients' trust and facing fines due to non-compliance.**Insufficient monitoring**. Many vulnerabilities are discovered too late and the consequences to your business and your clients can be dire. An API management platform works to prevent serious data leaks by monitoring any unusual activity.
### 7. Implement API Rate Limiting
Most apps and systems can only handle a certain number of requests before they get overloaded, experience slowdowns, or need to shut down. To prevent traffic overload, an API manager can use API rate limiting, API quotas, and spike arrests to throttle and slow down requests from overly-active IP addresses. These features can also trigger fees, cancel requests or send an error code to abusive IPs.

## How API Management and API Generation are Connected
[API generation](/a-complete-guide-to-api-generation) and API management are integral parts of the API lifecycle, working together to facilitate the efficient development and maintenance of APIs. API generation involves the automated creation of APIs from existing data sources or services, allowing developers to quickly define endpoints, methods, and data models without manual coding. This process leverages tools that connect directly to databases or cloud services, generating APIs that expose operations needed for application interactions.
In contrast, API management focuses on the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of APIs post-generation. It ensures APIs are secure, reliable, and scalable by providing features such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and traffic management. API management platforms also offer analytics and monitoring tools to track usage patterns and performance metrics, helping organizations understand API consumption and optimize their operations. Additionally, these platforms handle [API documentation](/8-api-documentation-examples), versioning, and policy enforcement, ensuring consistent standards and compliance across the API ecosystem.

The synergy between API generation and management lies in their continuous lifecycle integration. Modern platforms often combine these capabilities, enabling seamless transitions from API creation to management. This integration ensures that APIs are secure by design, as security policies and access controls are embedded from the outset. By providing a feedback loop where insights from API management inform future API updates and enhancements, organizations can maintain a robust and efficient API infrastructure that supports evolving business needs and technical requirements.
