Over the past two decades, I’ve witnessed nearly every phase of AI’s evolution — from genetic algorithms to neural networks, deep learning, predictive AI, and generative AI. Yet, at no point did I ever believe that AI would render all jobs obsolete, including those of software developers.

This perspective comes from someone who has introduced AI-powered services and experiences to the world. And yet, it’s the question I recently received from my computer science students: *Will AI tools make us obsolete?* I’ve had similar discussions with some of my writer friends, wondering if AI will entirely replace creators.

My response? *If someone uses AI to generate a painting, they’re not an artist unless they have the skills to create art without AI.*

The same applies to software development. The developer’s role isn’t disappearing — it’s evolving. Developers who embrace AI will optimize design, system thinking, architecture, and user experience in ways that automation alone never could. AI won’t replace developers; it will redefine what it means to be one.

Before we dive deeper into this evolution, let’s take a moment to talk about builders — a concept that is core to Twilio. At Twilio, we define builders as creators. They can be software developers, designers, or even individuals with no technical background. Understanding their needs is critical because those needs are constantly shifting.

For instance, developers spend only about two hours a day writing code — the rest of their time is consumed by meetings or waiting for builds. Their top priority? Productivity. They want tools that help them maximize their limited time to code.

Non-technical builders, on the other hand, have a similar but distinct need. They may not be experts in writing code, but they want the ability to create independently. For them, solutions like no-code/low-code platforms, AI assistants, and intuitive builder experiences are key to unlocking their potential and getting the job done efficiently.

The future of building — whether for developers or non-technical creators — isn’t about AI replacing them. It’s about AI enabling them to do more, faster, and with more significant impact.

**AI: A Force Multiplier in Software Development**
Much like a new coding language, AI is proving to be a formidable force multiplier for developers but not a replacement. Looking back over the years, [programming languages](https://thenewstack.io/programming-languages-coverage-matters-most-say-tns-readers/) like C were once the cornerstone of software development. As languages evolved to Python, Ruby, and Java, many predicted the need for fewer developers due to their ability to simplify complexity significantly. Yet, these predictions never materialized. The field did not shrink; instead, the [role of developers expanded](https://thenewstack.io/from-automation-to-optimization-ais-expanding-role-in-software-development/), incorporating more creative and abstract problem-solving skills.

A similar evolution is happening with AI today. While AI can [automate routine coding tasks](https://thenewstack.io/automate-routine-tasks-with-an-ad-hoc-ansible-script/), it cannot replace the higher-order creativity and systems thinking that skilled developers contribute. True builders are not merely code generators — they are creators, architects, and strategists who are equally capable of navigating ambiguity and influencing strategic change within an organization. These builders employ an interdisciplinary approach to designing, building, and managing complex systems.

**Shifting Focus: From Coding to System Design and Architecture**
AI is reshaping the role of developers, shifting the focus away from pure code generation toward system design and architectural thinking. In large-scale systems, how components and subsystems interact is often more critical to success than the individual lines of code.

At Twilio, we’ve seen this shift firsthand in communications technology. For years, we have focused on providing flexible APIs to abstract the complexity of communications — navigating regulations, security, and inconsistent implementations across channels. Developers valued that flexibility, but productivity became the top priority as their time became more constrained. In response, they began asking us to abstract even more complexity — leading us to our platform vision of evolving Twilio into a trusted, simple, and smart platform.

But why do trust, simplicity, and intelligence matter when discussing system design and productivity?

- Trust – Builders need to trust the platform they are building on. It must be reliable, secure, and resilient so they can focus on innovation without worrying about failures.
- Simple – Productivity is a developer’s top priority. The best systems remove friction, shorten time to production, and abstract complexity, making it easier to build and scale.
- Smart – Leveraging AI and contextual data reduces time, enhances experiences, and automates complexity, helping developers move faster and create more intuitive, impactful solutions.
This is the essence of systems thinking — moving beyond fragmented tools and point solutions to a cohesive, connected platform that enables builders to innovate faster and with greater impact. AI may enhance productivity, but the core of software development — design, architecture, and user experience — remains distinctly human.

**The New Builders **
*Let’s start with software development… *
So, what should [software developers focus on as they grow their skills](https://thenewstack.io/5-software-development-skills-ai-will-render-obsolete/)?

The [future of software development](https://thenewstack.io/are-cloud-based-ides-the-future-of-software-engineering/) isn’t about AI replacing developers — it’s about developers evolving into strategic, experience-driven builders who understand the technology, validate their work, and always keep the customer at the center of their work.

The evolution of [software development demands a greater emphasis on user](https://thenewstack.io/survey-86-of-oracle-java-users-migrating-to-alternatives/) experience, stronger testing skills, strategic AI implementation, and, above all, a deep understanding of customers and the technology they are using.

- User experience matters more than ever. Once an afterthought for many developers, it is now a fundamental component of system design. Builders should focus on creating seamless, intuitive interfaces because no matter how powerful a system is, its success depends on how easily users can engage with it.
- Master the basics before relying on AI. Just as an artist must first learn the fundamentals before creating masterpieces, developers must understand the core technologies they are working with. AI can assist in coding, but without a solid foundation in system architecture, debugging, and optimization, builders risk losing control over their work. True mastery comes from understanding the “why” behind your tools, not just how to operate them.
- Commit to better testing and validation. AI-generated code is not inherently reliable. Builders must ensure their code is correct, secure, and compliant — an effort that cannot be delegated entirely to automation. Just as you wouldn’t submit an AI-generated document without proofreading, you can’t ship AI-written code without thoroughly testing and validating it.
- Prioritize AI with purpose. AI isn’t a magic fix for everything. Builders must be intentional about their implementation, focusing on real customer needs. ROI and cost management will be central to a developer’s work — choosing when and where AI adds value versus where human expertise remains irreplaceable.
- Obsess over customer needs. The best developers don’t just write code — they solve problems. Understanding customer pain points, workflows, and desired outcomes is key to building solutions that truly make an impact. Whether designing more intuitive interfaces, improving automation, or optimizing performance, builders who put customer needs first will drive meaningful innovation.
*So what about other builders? *
Not all builders write code, but all builders create. Whether you’re a marketer, product manager, designer, or entrepreneur, the ability to build and bring ideas to life is more accessible than ever. The rise of AI, automation, and no-code/low-code platforms is reshaping how non-technical builders create, innovate, and drive impact. So, what skills will be essential for non-tech builders in this evolving landscape?

- Customer-first mindset. Like their developer counterparts, non-tech builders must stay obsessed with customer needs. Whether designing a marketing automation flow, building a sales outreach sequence, or creating an internal workflow, the best builders constantly ask, “How does this improve the user experience?”
- Data-driven decision making. The most impactful builders will be those who know how to leverage data. Whether it’s customer insights, campaign analytics, or product usage trends, data will guide better decisions, ensuring that every build is backed by evidence and not just intuition.
- Storytelling and communication. Even in a world of automation and AI, the ability to tell a compelling story remains essential. Whether pitching an idea, influencing stakeholders, or explaining how a new workflow improves efficiency, non-tech builders who can communicate their vision effectively will have a massive advantage.
- Experimentation and agility. No-code tools, automation, and AI have dramatically reduced the time it takes to bring ideas to life. The best builders will embrace a mindset of rapid experimentation — testing, iterating, and refining ideas quickly to maximize impact.
The rise of AI and automation doesn’t mean only developers can build — it means *anyone* with the right mindset and skills can. The next generation of builders will blend creativity with technical curiosity, [strategic thinking with data](https://thenewstack.io/data-management-strategy-is-more-strategic-than-you-think/) insights, and AI-driven efficiency with human intuition.

**Maintaining Long-term Success**
AI is not a replacement for builders — it’s a catalyst for evolution. As we navigate an era where AI is reshaping how we create, every builder — technical or not — must embrace new tools while staying grounded in creativity, problem-solving, and customer-centric thinking. True expertise begins with mastering the fundamentals; just as an artist must learn to paint before using digital tools, builders must develop foundational knowledge — whether in software development, product design, marketing, or business strategy — before relying on AI-generated solutions.

A flexible mindset and curiosity are key as the landscape of tools and technologies will continue to evolve, and those who eagerly explore new capabilities will thrive. At the same time, sharpening creative and analytical thinking remains essential, as AI can automate repetitive tasks, but human ingenuity is irreplaceable. Whether crafting a compelling narrative, solving a customer challenge, or designing an intuitive experience, success lies in the unique insights and creativity that builders bring to the table.

AI should be leveraged to enhance productivity, but it should never define the work itself — true innovation comes from knowing when to rely on automation and when to apply human judgment. The future is about empowering builders to create more, innovate faster, and push the boundaries of what’s possible. AI will continue to change how we build, but the essence of creation — the ability to think, design, and solve problems — will always belong to us. And if you truly want to become an artist, pick up your paintbrush and let’s go!
