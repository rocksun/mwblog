Throughout the development of networking, there has never been an effective way to capture and document the intended state of the network or to use that state to support network operations. Similarly, a go-to source for comprehensive training, guidance, and services on automating your network was unavailable.
In 2014, with the rise of network APIs and DevOps tools being applied to networking, observing those two realities was the core reason for starting Network to Code. For ten years, our mission has been to help individuals and organizations automate their networks in any way we can. It’s why we held the first in-person, five-day network automation training event. This is why I co-wrote “
[Network Programmability and Automation: Skills for the Next-Generation Network Engineer](https://www.amazon.com/Network-Programmability-Automation-Next-Generation-Engineer/dp/1491931256).” It’s what led us at Network to Code to launch Nautobot, an open source project and the first platform to integrate Network Source of Truth and network automation capabilities.
Now, seven years after that book’s publication, the industry has begun to recognize the value of data and its relationship to network automation. According to Gartner, although more than 65% of enterprise networking activities are performed manually, a small but growing percentage of large enterprises now automate more than half of their network activities. The Nautobot open source platform enables network teams to build a Network Source of Truth and deploy network automation, which is the core of those efforts. It is tremendous to see the growth and adoption of
[Nautobot](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot) from network engineers worldwide, even those in third world countries and organizations with no budget, showcasing our commitment to transform the network industry any way we can.
That’s why, in keeping with Network to Code’s mission, several of us have teamed up to co-author a new book on Nautobot, “
[Network Automation with Nautobot: Adopt a Network Source of Truth and a Data-driven Approach to Networking.](https://www.amazon.com/Network-Automation-Nautobot-data-driven-networking/dp/1837637865/ref=sr_1_1?crid=P0V3MM8MM49N&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.88tNZyhZAix83WhbiXf81g.H9zgiXsW-xQiPwhSKBzRZiYcpkviRUx9cd9Fk0MxS5c&dib_tag=se&keywords=Network+Automation+with+Nautobot%3A+Adopt+a+Network+Source+of+Truth+and+a+Data-driven+Approach+to+Networking.&qid=1716495685&s=books&sprefix=network+automation+with+nautobot+adopt+a+network+source+of+truth+and+a+data-driven+approach+to+networking.%2Cstripbooks%2C108&sr=1-1)” We want as many teams as possible with the knowledge and skills to build a strong foundation for a network automation stack.
In the book, network professionals learn how to deploy, manage, and integrate Nautobot as a Source of Truth and network automation platform by better understanding the relationship between data and automation. By the end, you can design and manage Nautobot deployments, understand its key features, and extend them by creating custom data models and Nautobot apps that suit your network and your team.
## Network Source of Truth
Since Nautobot’s creation, data and a Network Source of Truth have become increasingly crucial for network automation.
Automation requires organizations to collect and understand data that enables users to accurately define their network’s intended states. The problem is that many organizations need to understand their data clearly.
Why? Data is often scattered across various spreadsheets and custom internal databases that don’t communicate with each other. Sometimes, it’s scribbled down in notebooks, or there’s that one longtime engineer who remembers everything in his or her head. This is madness, and it must change.
Further complicating things, today’s networks are multivendor, multidomain, and connect to multiple clouds. There’s too much data for those legacy approaches to be practical.
There needs to be more sufficient and comprehensive documentation of this data — a Network Source of Truth.
The Nautobot open source project just turned three years old, and its user base continues to grow — particularly among large enterprises. Over the next three years, we expect to see more Nautobot open source integrations with third-party tools, accelerating network automation adoption even more.
## The Right Skills for Nautobot
One of the main points in the new Nautobot book is that non-technical skills are just as critical as technical skills (if not more so) when deploying network automation in general and Nautobot specifically. You need to understand how data can drive automation and how automation can deliver value to your organization when performing common workflows such as compliance, remediation, and network changes.
You don’t need to be an expert in every facet. The book assumes the reader has some background knowledge in network automation, such as Python or Ansible, and basic networking knowledge. However, if someone has hands-on networking experience and six to 12 months of experience using Python or Ansible, they can get value out of the book.
## The Future of Network Automation
Network automation is a rapidly evolving field, so it’s important to balance developing strong fundamentals with keeping up with emerging technology trends.
Open source tools and
[DevOps principles](https://thenewstack.io/devops/) are increasingly being incorporated into networking best practices, and there is an ongoing shift towards standardized automation architectures and frameworks. Networking professionals can access more insights into the data that powers automation. (Think application performance management, but for workflow analysis.) Artificial intelligence will accelerate the automation of quick wins but also create more problems for those unprepared to use it properly (i.e., without an end-to-end architecture or automated testing strategy).
As automation and AI become the de facto for network operations in the coming years, knowledge of NetDevOps principles and Infrastructure as Code will grow in importance. Nautobot will continue to evolve to meet the industry’s dynamic needs.
