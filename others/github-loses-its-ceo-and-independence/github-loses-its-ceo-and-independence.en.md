[Thomas Dohmke](https://thenewstack.io/github-ceo-on-why-well-still-need-human-programmers/), who has been at the helm of [GitHub](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/goodbye-github/) since 2021, today announced that he is stepping down to become a startup founder again.

[Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) has not publicly announced a successor and a company spokesperson told us that there is currently nothing more to announce beyond Dohmke’s own announcement.

[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/11/github-ceo-dohmke-step-down) reports that, based on an internal Microsoft memo, GitHub’s Chief Product Officer [Mario Rodriguez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariorodriguez3/) will report directly to [Asha Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aboutasha/), Microsoft’s corporate vice president of its AI platform. Meanwhile, [Julia Liuson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-liuson-6703441/),  head of Microsoft’s developer division, will oversee GitHub’s revenue, engineering and support (Dohmke previously reported directly to her).

Having talked to Dohmke many times over the years, GitHub’s independence from the overall Microsoft organization was always [a source of pride](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/26/four-years-after-being-acquired-by-microsoft-github-keeps-doing-its-thing/). Now, it seems like GitHub will be folded more closely into its parent organization. Whether any of this played a role in Dohmke’s decision, which at least from the outside seems rather sudden, isn’t clear.

A few years ago, that may have caused a bit of a stir, given that GitHub hosts most of the world’s open source projects and Microsoft’s relationship with the open source community hasn’t always been the best. Today, Microsoft’s standing in the open source world has improved quite a bit, even as there is still some (deserved) skepticism in some quarters.

Dohmke oversaw the platform’s shift from being almost solely focused on hosting enterprise and open source code to turning GitHub Actions into a major player in the continuous integration space and becoming a major player in the AI coding world with its various [Copilot](https://thenewstack.io/github-copilot-wants-to-become-your-peer-programmer/) products.

Recently, though, it felt like Windsurf, Cursor, Claude Code and others were gaining the majority of developer mindshare, if not market share. Copilot continued to gain users, with Dohmke recently saying it now has over 20 million users.

The German-born Dohmke joined Microsoft when he sold his startup HockeyApp, a mobile app developer tool that was a competitor to Apple’s TestFlight, in 2014. He later led the acquisition of GitHub from Microsoft’s engineering side and became its VP of strategic programs and then chief product officer during [Nat Friedman’s](https://github.com/nat) tenure as GitHub’s CEO. When Friedman left in late 2021, Microsoft tapped Dohmke as its successor.

“From building mobile developer tools, to running the acquisition of GitHub alongside Nat Friedman, to becoming GitHub’s CEO and guiding us into the age of Copilot and AI, it has been the ride of a lifetime,” Dohmke wrote in today’s announcement.

“Still, after all this time, my startup roots have begun tugging on me and I’ve decided to leave GitHub to become a founder again.”
