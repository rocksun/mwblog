[Vint Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf) with 85-year-old Robert Kahn for [a special presentation from the very room where they first wrote the TCP/IP protocol](https://ieeetv.ieee.org/video/in-the-room-where-tcp-happened) together more than 50 years ago.
“It’s truly an exciting honor to be here to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the work that Bob Kahn and I started, and so many have contributed to,” Cerf said during [a weekend of celebratory presentations](https://ieeetv.ieee.org/video/our-virtual-celebration-of-50-years-of-the-internet-an-ieee-milestone-event).

And he drew some fond applause for this philosophical aside. “The important thing about being able to celebrate a 50th anniversary is you’re still *around* to celebrate it!”

Cerf is now [a Google vice president](https://research.google/people/vinton-g-cerf/) and their chief internet evangelist. Kahn is now chair and CEO of the not-for-profit [Corporation for National Research Initiatives](https://www.cnri.reston.va.us/bios/kahn.html) (fostering R&D for the National Information Infrastructure). But using an internet connection for which he’d helped write the underlying protocols, Kahn dialed in for a virtual appearance with Cerf — waiting in the room where it happened — so they could tell, together, the story of the birth of the internet.

Along with some help from some of the others who’d helped make the world-changing moment happen…

## Network Effects
In [another event that weekend](https://ieeetv.ieee.org/video/creation-of-the-internet-with-vint-cerf-office-of-the-future), Cerf’s memory reached back to his days as a UCLA graduate student working on a clunky [Sigma](https://www.flickr.com/photos/fastlizard4/6294434636) [7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDS_Sigma_series). It was in September of 1969 that Cerf made it into the first node on ARPANET, with the next connecting node added in October at SRI. Cerf was part of the “Networking Working Group” created by [Steve Crocker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Crocker) (who helped developed ARPANET’s protocols).

Cerf remembered that Robert Kahn was also “very involved in the design of the ARPANET” (which Cerf explained was “a predecessor system to demonstrate that packet-switched communication would be a big thing for computers.”) But they weren’t the only ones thinking about networks. In 1971 the University of Hawaii had also built the radio frequency-based [ALOHAnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALOHAnet) — the world’s very first wireless packet network.

Both ARPANET and ALOHAnet “really led the way… to what we saw in the beginning of 1973,” Cerf said later.

Or, as Kahn put it, there were already “a number of different networks” in the early 1970s. By 1972 Bob Kahn — then at DARPA — even realized that a similar technology could be used for military command and control. (Cerf joked later that switching packets over phone circuits wouldn’t work for the military because “the tanks run over the wires, and the ships get all tangled up.) So Kahn had to move to radio.” Specifically, a packet radio system using both mobile vehicles and land-based radio repeaters…

Now they needed a way to connect up those networks — allowing the radio-based network to actually reach computers on the ARPAnet (which was necessary, as Kahn put it, “in order to make this mobile radio network useful in any sense.”)

There were different interfaces, data rates, and error controls — but in another presentation, Cerf finished the story succinctly. “So Bob Kahn had a lot of that in his head as he shows up at Stanford, and so we begin trying to figure out how to take these different kinds of networks and make them all look more uniform from the standpoint of the host computers that are out on the edges.

“It took us about six months to work our way through that.”

## Hints From PARC
There was another player in the brew. Xerox PARC had joined ARPANET early — by 1973 — and Cerf noted it was near Stanford, which undeniably resulted in some cross-pollination. Cerf then surprised the audience with an appearance from another important figure from 50 years ago — [John Shoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Shoch), who at the time was a Stanford student working at PARC. (Shoch remembered that “It was a great time to be in this particular area of computer and communications research. It’s hard to reproduce what the enthusiasm was in a whole new area.”)

But Cerf especially remembered Shoch’s “engagement” in Cerf’s seminars at Stanford — which happened, Shoch pointed out, while “I was technically a full-time employee and a full-time student, which was a little odd.” Shoch was working on a project that was very relevant and related — but also proprietary. (The PARC Universal Packet, which later led to the [Xerox Network Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Network_Systems).)

Cerf remembered with a smile that “they couldn’t really tells us in the seminar exactly what they were doing. But they were good collaborators — and so they tried to *hint* at things that might go wrong that we should pay attention to.

“So I want to thank John for his effort to help us steer this complex path toward where we ended up!”

In a later talk Cerf noted that early ARPANET protocols had “assumed absolute success in the network.” So it was very helpful to see three different examples of an alternate approach — with built-in considerations for end-to-end packet loss recovery (packet radio, packet satellite, and PARC’s Ethernet).

And Cerf also acknowledged that “We had help from a number of participants, because around late ’72, an organization called the International Network Working Group was formed.”

## A Paper for the Ages
Kahn had a communications perspective, Cerf had a computing perspective, and together they worked on the problem. With an upcoming workshop in England, they sat down to try to document their work.

Cerf laughed when Kahn remembered that after five or 10 minutes, Cerf had written nothing. “This was understandable, because this was a complex problem with many dimensions… So *I* just started to write. Because when I document things, I just tend to write and write and write, and then see what I’ve written, and figure out how to structure it to come out with what I intended.

“And so I was like eight pages into it. Vint came back, took a look at it, and said, ‘Okay. I know what to do.’ I think he wrote the next 20 or 30 pages or so, and then we iterated on what was on paper… It was a great experience.

“Vint seems to recall it lasted a day and a half or two, I seem to think it was only one. It could’ve been either, and it really doesn’t matter, because we got the job done.”

And Cerf added that “There’s a plaque next to the elevator that describes the work we did way back in ’73…”

The resulting paper was published in May of 1974, Cerf pointed out. “So 50 years have gone by — and the internet has blossomed in almost every possible dimension.”

![During the weekend, Cerf also remembered where he was on the 25th anniversary of the internet: posing for a <em>Newsweek</em> photo with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Crocker">Steve Crocker</A> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel">Jon Postel< (who together co-implemented the ARPANET protocols).](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2024/06/8e29ccbc-vint-cerf-shares-1999-photo-of-john-postel-and-steve-crocker-in-may-2024-at-ieee-i50-event-celebrating-50th-anniversary-of-internet.png)

## Judith Estrin, 50 Years Later
The story continued with an appearance by [Judith Estrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Estrin), now CEO of JLAbs, but at the time a Master’s student who joined the project after the spec (and first implementations) were in place. After the creation of the TCP/IP protocols in 1974, “I got to do the *testing* — late at night, early in the morning— with UCL [London] and [BBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raytheon_BBN).” Estin said she went on to a career “helping to build the networking industry, both local area network and the internet.” (Among other things, Estrin was CTO at Cisco from 1998 to 2000, [according to Forbes](https://archive.ph/20140304200228/http://www.forbes.com/profile/judith-estrin/).)

But 50 years down the road, Erin shared the three principles learned from Vint and Bob. “One of them is planning for uncertainty, and the protocols not assuming certain things from the layers below or the layers above.” A related principle is “interconnecting diversity for collective power, as opposed to scaling homogeneously” — and this implies an open systems environment and a level of collaboration and interdependence.

Estrin went on to note the world today seems to be shifting from that open systems philosophy to a consolidation of digital services “that now are ever-more powerful… And we went from community setting rules, and you had rights and responsibilities… now rules are set by the dominant player…

“And I just think that as digital services are already governing our lives, and as they become more and more impactful outside of just technology, we ought to go back and think about those philosophical things.”

## Thanking The Jetsons
Shoch revisited Cerf’s observation that engineering is about translating science fiction into reality. Then he thanked the visionaries who created *Dick Tracy* — “and therefore, loosely speaking…invented the Apple Watch” — as well as Hanna-Barbera, who created *The Jetsons*, a [1962 cartoon series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jetsons) set in a future with video phone calls…

It took half a century to first define the architecture — and then make it happen in the decades to come. But through it all, that architecture turned out to be both “pretty important and “well-conceived… there’s bunch of ideas that came out in your paper and other people’s work that endured pretty well.”

Shoch acknowledged some architectural errors. They’d originally used only an 8-bit number for indicating the network, “because we only thought there were going to be 256… ‘How would there ever be more than 256 networks?!’ ”

But what impresses him most about that half-century of evolution is how it proved the true flexibility of that architectural framework — “to accommodate orders of magnitude changes in number of users, bandwidth, geographic complexity. And no one could have predicted all of that.” (Cerf then also added “technology diversity,” noting the arrival optical fiber connections in the 1980s…)

“Trying to look forward, I see a lot of uncertainty, and things that I cannot predict. I’m not as good as Hanna-Barbera in predicting what will come next. But having an open architecture — and we can have a long conversation about what that means — gives me some confidence that there’s enough flexibility to accommodate new applications, new communications — and we hope that will continue.”
