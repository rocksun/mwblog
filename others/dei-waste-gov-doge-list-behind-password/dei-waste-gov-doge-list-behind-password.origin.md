A German researcher captured the contents of the White House’s “DEI.gov” during a brief period when it was not password protected.

The capture shows that the site contains a list of vague, alleged government-funded tasks and their costs, without sources or context, like “$1.3 million to Arab and Jewish photographers," “$1.5 million for ‘art for inclusion of people with disabilities,’” and "$3.4 million for Malaysian drug-fueled gay sex app.” DEI.gov redirects to waste.gov and is currently inaccessible without a password; Elon Musk told reporters on Tuesday that his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is “trying to be as transparent as possible.”

The researcher is Henrik Schönemann, a historian who started the [ Safeguarding Research & Culture archivalist project](https://safeguarding-research.discourse.group/?ref=404media.co),

[posted screenshots on Mastodon](https://fedihum.org/@lavaeolus/113998679846185670?ref=404media.co)showing the contents. Schönemann also shared the specific site scrapes that he was able to capture, which showed the contents of the site. He told 404 Media he set up a change detection app using PikaPods, and is monitoring changes across hundreds of government websites. When the dei.gov and waste.gov sites were registered 10 days ago, he started tracking them, too.
Before the site administrators added a Wordpress template to the pages, the list was online at those URLs. This list was only online for a maximum of 30 minutes, starting around 4:50 p.m. EST; by 5:23 p.m. on February 11, it was gone from public view, according to the snapshots Schönemann’s app captured.

According to the screenshots provided by Schönemann, the list includes (all of the following are direct quotes):

- $78,000 to Palestinian activist group whose chairman was photographed attending an anniversary event celebrating the founding of the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Palestine terrorist group

Schönemann told 404 Media he wanted to share a sentiment alongside his find: “People all around the world care, you are not alone. And: #TransRights.”

Earlier this week, we reported that the Trump administration had set up a website called waste.gov, which was live on the internet with a sample page from a default WordPress template. Both DEI.gov and waste.gov were created at the same time, according to Reuters, and [ DEI.gov was recently set up to redirect to waste.gov](http://dei.gov/?ref=404media.co). After our reporting, both websites were put behind a password wall.
