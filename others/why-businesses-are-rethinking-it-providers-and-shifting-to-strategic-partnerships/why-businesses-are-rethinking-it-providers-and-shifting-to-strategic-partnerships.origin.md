# Why Businesses Are Rethinking IT Providers and Shifting to Strategic Partnerships
When selecting an IT provider, you’re not just choosing a service vendor—you’re forming a relationship that will drive your business’s future. In today’s complex digital environment, the right partner must offer strategic insight, adaptability, innovation, and essential services.

The first and most crucial step in selecting an IT provider is defining your objective. Do you need managed services to handle daily IT operations, a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model to create and transition a custom solution, or are you focused on IT infrastructure, product development, or software engineering? Each path has distinct approaches, challenges, and long-term impacts, requiring careful consideration.

Before proceeding, it’s essential to secure organizational buy-in. Identify your internal champion, recognize those who might resist change, and prepare strategies to address their concerns.

Another critical aspect is funding. How will this project be financed? Is it part of your operational or capital budget, or are you exploring third-party options? The IT provider can often offer financial solutions or flexible payment options to help mitigate upfront costs and make the transition more feasible.

By clarifying your goals, internal dynamics, and financial strategy, you’ll be more likely to find an IT provider aligned with your immediate needs and long-term objectives.

## Think About Long-Term Business Alignment, Not Just Services
One of the most overlooked aspects of choosing an IT provider is ensuring its vision and philosophy align with your long-term goals. Many businesses focus on the here and now, evaluating providers based on their current technology stack or support models. Your IT provider must be able to keep pace not just with your current needs but also with your future aspirations.

To solve this, begin your search by mapping out where your business is headed over the next 5-10 years. Are you focused on expanding into new markets? Do you expect to rely more heavily on data analytics, artificial intelligence, or automation? Look for IT providers whose portfolio shows they’ve successfully evolved with their clients.

**Solution Tip**: Ask them to share how they see technology evolving in your industry over the next 3-5 years and how they plan to help your company stay ahead of those changes.
## Involve the Business as an Integral Part of the Discussion
Your business stakeholders must be actively involved in the decision-making process when selecting an IT provider. They must understand the importance of aligning IT solutions with business objectives. While the IT team may handle the technical aspects, the business [teams are responsible for producing and selling your products](https://thenewstack.io/why-you-should-run-your-platform-team-like-a-product-team/) or services. They will ultimately rely on the data and systems that the IT provider will support or build.

Without business involvement, you risk selecting solutions that don’t fully align with the company’s operational needs or customer demands.

**Solution Tip**: When evaluating potential IT providers, ensure that business stakeholders from critical departments such as sales, production, and customer service are included in vendor demonstrations and discussions.
## Develop a Collaborative Strategy Session
Too often, selecting an IT provider is treated as a procurement exercise. But, as IT is integral to your business, the provider should be approached as a partner from day one. Instead of the standard Request for Proposal (RFP) process, initiate a strategy session where the potential provider collaborates with your leadership team to brainstorm ways technology can solve your business challenges.

**Solution Tip**: [FPT Software](https://fptsoftware.com/) recently partnered with a leading North American imaging solutions provider on a 2.5-year, $10 million digital transformation journey. This project was special because of our mutual commitment to [technological innovation](https://fptsoftware.com/accompany-your-transformation) and cultural values like diversity, inclusion, and environmental responsibility.
## Shift From SLAs to Strategic Outcomes
While Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are the standard method for managing expectations, they often focus on operational metrics rather than business outcomes. For example, a provider could propose solutions that improve your sales process, streamline your supply chain, or enhance customer experience.

FPT Software helped a major automotive company consolidate 193 vendors into a single, efficient service provider through a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model. Recognizing the importance of involving business stakeholders, the company engaged its production and sales teams early in decision-making. Instead of simply negotiating SLAs, FPT and the client defined strategic outcomes.

For the “Build” phase, FPT created an offshore team in Vietnam with the required Java, .NET, and cloud technologies skills, ensuring alignment with the company’s operational needs. During the “Operate” phase, FPT managed day-to-day operations while maintaining low attrition and strong governance, always keeping business objectives at the forefront. In the “Transfer” phase, 60% of the workforce was seamlessly integrated into the company’s internal teams, ensuring operational continuity and supporting strategic growth.

## Ensure Cultural Compatibility and a Strong Partnership Dynamic
Technology expertise aside, a significant factor in your long-term success with an IT provider is cultural fit. You need a provider that shares your values. This might mean selecting a partner who values innovation as much as you do or one who prioritizes social responsibility or diversity in technology.

Cultural compatibility also means the provider should fit seamlessly into your existing teams. They need to be able to work with your internal stakeholders, understand your communication norms, and match your company’s pace.

**Solution Tip**: Before selecting FPT as their long-term partner, one client was eager to understand who we are. They conducted workshops to get to know our [team and ensure our mission and vision aligned](https://thenewstack.io/entrepreneurship-for-engineers-why-team-alignment-matters/) with theirs. This emphasis on cultural fit sets the tone for a collaborative and meaningful partnership.
## Demand Continuous Improvement and Innovation
An often missed opportunity when selecting an IT provider is ensuring that they bring ongoing innovation. Too many companies settle into a transactional relationship with their IT provider, where the provider only steps in when something breaks. However, technology moves quickly, and your provider should act as an advisor who constantly recommends ways to improve processes, introduce new technologies, and reduce costs.

**Solution Tip**: In supporting their cloud-based platform for an Instant Messaging platform designed for the financial industry, FPT Software provided end-to-end development services, including backend and frontend development, DevOps, UI testing, and performance improvements. Our 100+ member team consistently rolled out new features, developed integrations with third-party services, and ensured the platform remained robust through comprehensive automation and performance testing. Our commitment extended beyond maintenance, as we proposed and delivered new products leveraging open APIs, webhooks, and bots to enhance the platform’s value. Using technologies such as ReactJS, Java Spring, Apache Kafka, and Amazon CloudWatch, we helped reduce the client’s R&D costs while maintaining [top-tier security standards](https://fptsoftware.com/newsroom/news-and-press-releases/press-release/fpt-software-recognized-in-the-idc-marketscape-asia-pacific-mss-pss).
## Explore Their Ecosystem and Partnerships
The best IT providers aren’t operating in a silo. They have a robust ecosystem of technology partners, from cloud providers to cybersecurity firms, to tap into when needed. This allows them to offer multiple solutions rather than forcing you into a one-size-fits-all package. A provider with solid relationships across the tech landscape is better positioned to provide customized, high-quality solutions.

**Solution Tip**: Ask potential providers to present their partner ecosystem and demonstrate how they leverage these partnerships to benefit their clients.
## Choose a Partner for Business Growth, Not Just IT Support
Selecting an IT provider requires more than a surface-level evaluation of services and pricing. By engaging in more profound, strategic conversations, focusing on cultural fit, and aligning on long-term goals, you can ensure that your chosen provider will meet your current [needs and help drive your business’s](https://thenewstack.io/5-signs-your-business-needs-an-operations-intervention/) future growth.
