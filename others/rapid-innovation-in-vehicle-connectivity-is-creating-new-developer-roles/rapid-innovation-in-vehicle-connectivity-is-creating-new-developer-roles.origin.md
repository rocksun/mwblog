I have worked in the software industry for the past three decades and, in that time, have seen considerable evolutions in [software development](https://thenewstack.io/software-development/). I am passionate about understanding technology’s impact on people’s daily lives and what technology consumers want to pay for.

As society evolves, the technological landscape shifts in tandem, reflecting the changing values, needs, and behaviors of the population. Advancements in technology often seek to address societal challenges, offering solutions that can enhance quality of life, improve efficiency, and foster connectivity. Working to stay ahead of these societal changes is crucial.

I have seen first-hand how modern mobility has advanced at warp speed. Most notably, electric vehicles, mobility-as-a-service (MaaS), and autonomous driving have all developed to become the poster children of advancements in the mobility industry. Lesser-known advancements in today’s mobility equipment are happening behind the scenes and are indebted to an upgrade in connectivity technologies.

**Making the Connection from the Cloud to the Car**
In [software-defined vehicles](https://thenewstack.io/eclipse-foundation-gears-up-the-software-defined-vehicle/) (SDVs), connectivity refers to integrating communication technologies within the vehicle, enabling internal vehicle systems and external communications with other vehicles, infrastructure, and services.

Connectivity touches all aspects of a vehicle, greatly enhancing the driving experience. Navigation, real-time traffic data, media streaming, and wireless smartphone syncing all rely on connectivity. Other experience-related capabilities that depend on connectivity include remote start, vehicle location, app updates, and viewing vehicle fuel or battery status from a smartphone.

Much like a computer or smartphone needs to be routinely updated, software-defined vehicles do as well. The ability to wirelessly deploy updates to a vehicle has the potential to transform the automotive and transportation industries, though challenges to widespread adoption persist. Fundamental industry challenges around software applications, particularly outsourcing complexities, must be resolved for traditional Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to keep pace with industry evolution.

Legacy OEMs face complexities in deploying over-the-air (OTA) updates that can improve functionality and cybersecurity, as many vehicle modules are outsourced to multiple suppliers. External partners may not facilitate a harmonious software ecosystem, hindering the ability to implement improvements or address cyber threats quickly.

Overcoming unique challenges to legacy OEMs will undoubtedly take time, but ultimately allow them to fully leverage the benefits, gather actionable insights about vehicle performance, and deploy necessary OTAs. Optimizing the vehicle in this way can lead to safer and more efficient vehicle performance, ultimately extending the car’s lifespan and improving safety and efficiency.

With connectivity capabilities, the vehicle’s telematics allows data to be transmitted back to the OEMs, granting remote access to valuable insights gathered from the vehicle’s data. Such data is imperative for fleet management, diagnostics, filing insurance claims, and even predictive maintenance.

Overall vehicle performance metrics about engine operation, fuel consumption, battery usage, and emissions data can be leveraged by the OEM to improve vehicle safety, enhance performance, and offer more personalized services to vehicle owners.

The most notable connected capability within modern transportation is the Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). For a vehicle to operate without a human driver, it must be able to gather real-time data from its surroundings, other vehicles, and traffic equipment to navigate the roads safely and efficiently. Imagine the vehicle as able to speak for itself rather than drive itself. This data must be processed quickly and accurately so that the vehicle may react in time to unknown variables that occur in real-world scenarios, all of which rely on robust connectivity solutions.

While it is still in the early stages, autonomous driving capabilities have transformed the relationship between the driver and the automobile. As this technology continues to mature, private autonomous vehicles will become more mainstream, and so will autonomous delivery and agricultural equipment fleets, impacting more aspects of modern life than just private transportation.

Advancement in connectivity is positively impacting the automotive industry economically and technologically. The need for skilled software and network engineers has opened up robust job [opportunities](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/attracting-and-retaining-tech-talent-to-sustain-mobilitys-growth) for tech workers. With the global SDV market [estimated](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/01/17/2590126/0/en/Connected-Car-Market-size-is-projected-to-reach-USD-361-Billion-by-2030-growing-at-a-CAGR-of-17-3-Straits-Research.html) to reach a value of 361 billion USD by 2030, up significantly from the 86 billion USD valuation in 2021, it is only expected to grow.

For OEMs, the opportunity is tenfold. OEMs investing in connected technologies and deploying updates to resolve issues are finding new revenue in subscription-based OTA updates and enhancing customer experiences, thus increasing the opportunity to retain customers over a more extended period. The exponential growth of the connected vehicles, fleets, and machinery market is aiding in creating a more dynamic and profitable mobility ecosystem.

### Conquering Challenges to Connectivity
Connected capabilities can unlock a trove of possibilities for mobility equipment. However, as one can expect, it is not so simple to connect devices, let alone large equipment and automotive, in every part of the world. Many rural areas and even [entire countries](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1155552/countries-highest-number-lacking-internet/) lack robust and reliable network infrastructure.

5G coverage is expanding to more rural areas, though coverage is only partially reliable. To combat this and provide connectivity in rural locations, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) rely on a combination of communication technologies. Leveraging multiple networks for cross-border connectivity is the next step in launching modern mobility technology globally.

To ensure seamless cross-border connectivity, multiple network connections keep vehicles constantly connected and able to receive and send data while also complying with local regulations. This can include next-generation cellular networks like 5G and Wi-Fi connections. For extremely remote areas, satellite connectivity can also be used to ensure seamless coverage. The vehicle switches between these networks depending on where connectivity is the strongest, enabling a global connection regardless of where it is located.

The vehicle can also be equipped with native capabilities that can help compensate for poor connectivity. Before it leaves the assembly line, the vehicle can be armed with edge computing capabilities. This allows an SDV to process and analyze data locally rather than relying on constant cloud connectivity. With edge computing, select systems and features can operate as usual, independent of the quality of the vehicle’s connection.

Vehicles can also be programmed with predictive data transfer capabilities to anticipate areas with low connectivity and preemptively download necessary software updates, navigation, and infotainment capabilities.

### Down the Road
Looking to the future, I expect a deepening and acceleration of advancements in connectivity solutions. Progress made today in multinetwork connectivity, edge computing, and predictive data transfer has played a pivotal role in spearheading the connected mobility movement. As these technologies mature and become more integrated into the modern automotive landscape, they will continue to shape the future of mobility, making it safer, more efficient, and accessible to all.
