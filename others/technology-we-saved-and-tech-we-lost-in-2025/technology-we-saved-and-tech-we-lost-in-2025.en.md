As fast as the old year passes, it’s been heartening to see people preserving the work of those who came before us. The Computer History Museum, Stack Overflow and countless nonprofits and foundations have carried yesterday’s operating systems, technical discussions and other creative works forward into a fresh new year.

As our technology continues to evolve through time — some becoming obsolete, and others still being resurrected unexpectedly — we see signs that the tech world is a community that preserves its history and its heritage.

And in 2025, some of their preservation efforts were especially dramatic.

## The Discovery of a 1974 Unix Tape

It was a day to remember. University of Utah research professor [Rob Ricci](https://ricci.io/) — whose work usually involves building cloud-based infrastructure — discovered a surprise while cleaning out a storage room. Buried inside a forgotten box, “Our staff found this tape containing UNIX v4 from Bell Labs, circa 1973,” Ricci [posted on Mastodon](https://discuss.systems/@ricci/115504720054699983).

Because this could be the only remaining copy of Unix v4, the reel of magnetic tape was carefully transported to Silicon Valley. Ricci noted the staffer who found it drove the precious tape to the museum rather than trust it to mail carriers.

There, the tape was lovingly resurrected and read again for the first time by [Al Kossow](https://computerhistory.org/profile/al-kossow/), software curator at Silicon Valley’s Computer History Museum — with the moment [shared](https://exquisite.tube/w/qoHtHzpNXncHwrfqpx31tF) on our modern-day social media. “So far, some of our folks think they have found Hunt The Wumpus,” Ricci [posted playfully](https://discuss.systems/@ricci/115748587328701031), “and the C code for a Snobol interpreter.”

[![Screenshot from Robert Ricci social media post about Unix v4](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/1c1a9089-screenshot-from-robert-ricci-social-media-post-about-unix-v4.png)](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/1c1a9089-screenshot-from-robert-ricci-social-media-post-about-unix-v4.png)

And halfway around the globe, a Berlin-based retrocomputing enthusiast created a [site with the contents of the tape ready for bootstrapping](http://squoze.net/UNIX/v4/README), including all the necessary instructions for hobbyists to bring it to life on their own systems.

So what technological artifacts did they find? Ricci [posted later](https://discuss.systems/@ricci/115749601614636888) that it seems to include a file named *sh.c*, which he suspects may be the oldest known version of a shell program in [C](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-c-programming-language/). And one social media user noticed the OS’s time-conversion code [includes a flagging variable named *nixonflg*](https://social.atypique.net/@zorun/115751343053946103), apparently commemorating one of 1974’s memorable moments.

That January — seven months before resigning from office — President Nixon had enacted a [year-round switch to daylight saving time](https://www.congress.gov/bill/93rd-congress/senate-bill/2702). That move was [rescinded](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/sites/default/files/pdf_documents/library/document/0055/1668702.pdf) eight weeks into the presidency of Gerald Ford, but the Unix tape still has its *nixonflg* variable, which “if set to 1, will cause daylight saving time all year around independently of ‘daylight.'”

Tom’s Hardware [called the tape](https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/unix-v4-recovered-from-randomly-found-tape-at-university-of-utah-only-known-copy-of-first-os-version-with-kernel-and-core-utilities-written-in-c) “a Christmas gift that should warm many a cold sysadmin’s heart,” remembering that at the time the tape was created, Unix “was still an escaped lab experiment.”

And on December 26, Ricci posted [another tantalizing announcement](https://discuss.systems/@ricci/115787578199513770). “[B]y the way, there are more tapes. We sent a box of other tapes to the Computer History Museum along with the UNIX V4 tape.” These include a 34-year-old version of Hewlett-Packard’s own proprietary version of Unix and some 1988 software from mt Xinu (which made a commercially licensed version of BSD Unix). While the findings “are not necessarily ‘lost,’ and may not be redistributable due to licensing issues,” Ricci seemed excited on social media.

He posted, “I’ll let you know if they find anything interesting on them.”

## Stack Overflow Shutters Its Data Centers

Far from Utah — in New Jersey — Stack Overflow reached its own milestone in 2025, finally moving its operations entirely into the cloud and abandoning the physical servers its site reliability engineering (SRE) team has managed “for almost our entire 16-year existence.”

In 2025, Stack Overflow carefully culled its hardware while still preserving all its *digital* content.

The day of “the great unracking,” blog/podcast editor [Ryan Donovan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-donovan-1477b64/) remembered fondly that the servers “had a warm spot in our history and our hearts.”

When he’d joined the company in 2019, he’d spotted “the original server mounted on a wall with a laudatory plaque like a beloved pet.” But in a [July 2 blog post](https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/12/24/the-great-unracking-saying-goodbye-to-the-servers-at-our-physical-datacenter/), he marked the day they’d unplugged over 400 cables — “Our de-cabling process involved throwing everything into the corner of the room” — and building seven large piles of decommissioned servers/network devices. “So long and thanks for all the bits!”

[![Junk pile of cords - screenshot of image from Stack Overflow blog (originally published July 2)](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/678398c3-junk-pile-of-cords-screenshot-of-image-from-stack-overflow-blog-originally-published-july-2.png)](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/678398c3-junk-pile-of-cords-screenshot-of-image-from-stack-overflow-blog-originally-published-july-2.png)

And then: 50 servers were shredded or destroyed “for security reasons (and to protect the personally identifiable information of all our users and customers).” As the site’s Director of Reliability Engineering told him, “No need to be gentle anymore.” Over the last 16 years, its SRE team handled all the cabling and racking (and replacing of failed disks), work the blog post remembers “required someone to physically show up at the data center and poke the machines.”

But now? “Our servers are now cattle, not pets. Nobody is going to have to drive to our New Jersey data center and replace or reboot hardware.”

## Other Tech Farewells and Preservations of 2025

In addition to Unix v 4, 2025 saw other moments where the world’s technological history was preserved and honored.

But 2025 also some some technologies saying goodbye. AOL pulled the plug on its [dial-up internet service](https://help.aol.com/articles/dial-up-internet-to-be-discontinued). Roomba [filed for bankruptcy](https://www.reuters.com/technology/irobot-enters-chapter-11-lender-acquire-roomba-maker-2025-12-15/). PC Magazine even created its own memorial, titled [“Connection Lost: The Tech That Died in 2025,”](https://www.pcmag.com/news/tech-that-died-in-2025-aol-dial-up-skype-dyson-zone-pocket) including the [Humane AI Pin](https://thenewstack.io/ambient-ai-humanes-ai-pin-embarks-on-a-dreams-long-road/) and [Skype](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/skype-is-retiring-in-may-2025-what-you-need-to-know-2a7d2501-427f-485e-8be0-2068a9f90472).

And Enron.com relaunched after its trademark was bought by a T-shirt company that joked they were now working on [egg-shaped nuclear reactors](https://enron.com/pages/the-egg).

## Looking Ahead to 2026

So maybe today is the perfect day to celebrate what we *didn’t* lose in 2025. Despite the death of Vim creator [Bram Moolenaar](https://thenewstack.io/bram-moolenaar-author-of-the-open-source-vim-code-editor-has-died/) in 2023, Vim [is still carrying on](https://thenewstack.io/vim-after-bram-a-core-maintainer-on-how-theyve-kept-it-going/). And even the [International Obfuscated C Code Contest](https://www.ioccc.org/) returned again in 2025 — after a four-year hiatus — to [celebrate and honor its 40th anniversary](https://thenewstack.io/the-obfuscated-c-code-contest-confronts-the-age-of-ai/). In one of the most touching moments of the year, 75-year-old EFF cofounder [Mitch Kapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor) even finished that grad school program [he’d dropped out of in 1979](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/24/business/mitch-kapor-mit-degree-bill-aulet/) to found Lotus.

Kapor wrote a [timely and heartfelt thesis](https://www.d-eship.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kapor-mdkapor-msms-ssm-2025-sig.pdf) on “gap-closing investing.”

And as we look to the future, we can already see more tech milestones heading towards us in 2026. [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) will turn up [on a $1 coin](https://www.usmint.gov/news/press-releases/united-states-mint-releases-2026-american-innovation-one-dollar-coin-program-designs).

[![Steve Jobs coin - 2026-American-Innovation-Unc-Reverse-California.jpg](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/6aa184fc-steve-jobs-coin-2026-american-innovation-unc-reverse-california.jpg)](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/6aa184fc-steve-jobs-coin-2026-american-innovation-unc-reverse-california.jpg)

Java will [stop supporting Java applets](https://inside.java/2025/12/03/applet-removal/). We’ll see the [relaunch of Digg.com](https://reboot.digg.com/), and Lara Croft will [resume raiding tombs](https://youtu.be/n6JxVxSHjqE).

And as the sun rises on January 1, hundreds of sound recordings from 1925 will [finally enter the public domain](https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2026/) — along with hundreds of published works from 1930.

Maybe it’s all proof that the tech world remains a dynamic place — still remembering its past even as it looks ahead to a dramatically different future. As always in 2026, the question will not be what technologies we have, but how we’ll end up using them. But at least those who remember their past are not doomed to repeat it.

And it’s heartening that 2025 included some shining examples of the tech world being a community that preserves its history.
