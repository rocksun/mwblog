A bill that would ban the use of mRNA vaccines, including for Covid-19, is on its way to the House floor after passing out of committee in a party-line vote Wednesday.

Sponsored by Rep. Greg Kmetz, R-Miles City, and co-sponsored by Northwest Montana Reps. Tracy Sharp, R-Polson, and Lukas Schubert, R-Kalispell, House Bill 371 would prohibit administering vaccines developed with mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid, technology on humans. The bill deems the technology, which was employed to create the Covid-19 vaccines, a hazard.

The House Judiciary Committee on Feb. 12 voted 12-8 to send the bill to the floor. Sharp, along with local Reps. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, and committee Chair Amy Regier, R-Kalispell, voted in favor.

The bill was amended to specify that the legislation would ban mRNA vaccines “for infectious diseases" and not “gene therapy products used to treat cancers or genetic disorders.”

Supporters had previously testified that the vaccines caused more harm than good.

“[mRNA vaccines are] the most destructive and lethal medical products that have ever been used in medical history,” Dr. Christine Drivdahl-Smith, a family physician in Miles City, told the committee earlier this month.

Opponents, though, said mRNA vaccines safely help the body build antibodies against diseases. They also argued that removing vaccines limits individual choice and involved the government in health care decisions.

“This bill interferes with the health care provider, patient relationships, it interferes with the practice of medicine,” said Dr. Douglas Harrington, a preventative medicine physician and the state medical officer for the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, during testimony earlier this month.
