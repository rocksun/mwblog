Five years ago, the COVID pandemic forced businesses to make massive changes in their operations wholesale. [IT spending surged to nearly $3.8 billion in 2020 and $4.4 billion in 2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268938/global-it-spending-by-segment/) as companies moved quickly to buy tools that ensured they could continue to operate.

These weren’t just tools like Zoom or cloud storage. eCommerce platforms were snapped up by brick-and-mortar businesses that had to sell online for the first time. Medical practices rushed to implement new telehealth platforms to continue meeting their patients, and insurance companies had to adopt remote tools so customers could file claims when loss adjusters couldn’t inspect in person.

While many of these investments were necessary to survive the uncertainty of the early 2020s, organizations are now stuck with a patchwork of tools and platforms that are difficult to maintain, scale, or integrate.

Now, businesses are poised for another massive change in their operations: AI. To succeed in this new era, tech leaders must learn from four key lessons that the pandemic-driven digital rush taught us.

**1) Understanding Consumer Expectations**
Businesses that kept their consumers’ expectations front and center excelled during the digital rush. Nations Lending Corporation, for example, was already accelerating its technology shift before the pandemic with machine learning and AI adoption. That meant when customers transitioned to online-only in 2020, they spent less time on the phone, less time filling out paperwork, and experienced 50% fewer delays than the industry average.

With consumers’ expectations for digital engagement at an all-time high, businesses must understand the importance of providing a smooth, user-friendly experience across channels to drive satisfaction and loyalty across all generations. [Our recent State of Customer Conversations Report](https://www.smartcommunications.com/resources/benchmark-report/) showed that 85% of customers now consider communication a vital part of their overall experience, and 66% are likely to leave if their communication expectations are not met.

Healthcare providers are leading the way in this area, increasingly adopting digital technologies to improve patient access and efficiency. They offer online platforms for scheduling appointments, remote care, or personalized treatment plans.

Using trusted data will create a frictionless [digital journey and drive](https://thenewstack.io/driving-digital-experiences-via-cloud-native-applications/) quicker outcomes. This will help companies gain customer trust while encouraging them to share valuable data essential for personalized experiences.

**2) Dispelling Infrastructure Fragmentations **
[A whopping 97% of companies](https://pages.twilio.com/rs/294-TKB-300/images/Twilios-Covid-19-Digital_Engagement_Report_4832.pdf) said the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated their digital transformation initiatives. But while these temporary solutions or “quick fixes” kept operations running, their rushed implementation has, in many cases, left a legacy of disjointed tools that can’t scale or integrate effectively.
These new solutions are clashing with legacy [systems to create data silos and system fragmentations](https://thenewstack.io/data-dependent-applications-system-fragmentation/), leaving customer communications and experiences disconnected.

By investing in interoperable platforms, companies can create a connected, secure ecosystem where data flows, and teams can collaborate without silos. A more holistic approach to different solutions can streamline operations and help organizations make better data-driven decisions.

**3) Building Resilience With Scalability**
Another factor businesses [must consider in modern infrastructure](https://thenewstack.io/you-must-prioritize-compliance-in-modern-infrastructure/) is scalability, which allows them to pivot as required when disruptions arise. When the pandemic lockdowns drove consumers online in unprecedented numbers, many companies suffered from outages and slowdowns in their services as their infrastructure couldn’t handle the sudden increase in demand.

Scalability requires a holistic view of system infrastructures to determine if current [systems can handle changing market demands](https://thenewstack.io/why-cloud-native-systems-demand-a-zero-trust-approach/) and growing workloads. This way, organizations can assess whether their current systems can sustain new tools and meet customer expectations.

A resilient and scalable infrastructure means businesses can evolve with customer and market demands, integrate new, ground-breaking technologies, and create robust, future-ready foundations. Cloud native solutions can provide flexibility to adjust resources, cutting unnecessary expenses and enhancing agility at scale.

**4) Embracing AI and Data-Driven Insights**
Enterprise IT has been fighting an uphill battle with data quality and governance for years, but when the digital rush took off in 2020, these challenges hit home. The rapid deployment of new technologies shone a harsh light onto data silos, poor metadata, and weak governance frameworks, highlighting how much work still needed to be done and, in some cases, worsening the problem.

These mistakes cannot be repeated if organizations are to be successful with AI, where data quality and governance are critical. Doing so will compromise the effectiveness of AI models, which could hurt the customer experience as these features are rolled out. Exceptional customer communications and interactions with AI usage [depend on updated](https://thenewstack.io/ai-assisted-dependency-updates-without-breaking-things/), clean, and consistent data.

Organizations must start with secure and simple processes to ensure that the customer information collected is accurate and complete. For example, insurers’ [data management processes](https://thenewstack.io/how-event-processing-builds-business-speed-and-agility/) must have strong governance, data audits, and continuous monitoring to improve policyholder experiences and ensure practical AI implementations.

Customer trust is especially imperative when it comes to data collection and AI. Our report found that two-thirds of customers say they have ethical (63%) and security concerns (66%) about the use of GenAI in communications. To continue delivering value to customers through AI, businesses need to prioritize transparency by making it clear when they’re using AI and ensuring human oversight throughout the communication process.

Better data quality ensures organizations are positioned to adapt to emerging technologies. Establishing high-quality, integrated data with the right processes can deliver better customer experiences across different industries, especially as AI models become increasingly sophisticated.

**Looking Ahead**
The speed and scale of upheaval cannot be overstated as we reflect on the myriad impacts of the pandemic’s onset five years ago. It took less than three months from the virus’s discovery for most of the world to enter a total lockdown, and businesses needed to make rapid decisions to survive the economic downturn.

The transformation that AI promises will not be as quick, but it could have an even greater impact on the way we use technology in our lives. Business leaders have the opportunity to learn from the digital rush and ensure they are on a better footing for the future.
