[Software engineers](https://thenewstack.io/software-engineers-remain-indispensable-in-the-age-of-ai/) are spending most of their time on stuff they hate — and almost none on the work they really want to do.

That’s the key finding from [Chainguard](https://www.chainguard.dev/?utm_content=inline+mention)[‘](https://www.chainguard.dev/)s 2026 Engineering Reality Report, released today, which surveyed 1,200 software engineers and tech leaders across the US and Europe. The numbers are stark: Engineers spend just 16% of their week writing code and building new features, despite 93% saying that’s the most rewarding part of their jobs.

What do they do with the rest of their time? Code maintenance, [technical debt](https://thenewstack.io/technical-debt-continues-to-mount-heres-how-to-solve-it/) and wrestling with fragmented tools.

“Engineers aren’t spending nearly as much time building, creating and innovating as they would like to,” said [Dustin Kirkland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustinkirkland/), Chainguard’s SVP of Engineering. “Far too much of their time is spent on maintenance tasks.”

## Burnout Is Real

Only one in three engineers say they spend most of their time on work that energizes them. More than a third (35%) point to excessive workload and burnout as major problems, while 72% said the mounting demands make it hard to find time for building new features.

The culprits are familiar to anyone who’s worked in software: tedious tasks (38% cited this as a barrier), ongoing code maintenance like patches and vulnerability management (another 38%), and the technical debt that two-thirds of engineers say they bump into all the time.

Then there’s the tool problem. Nearly half of respondents said tool-related issues hurt their experience, with 87% reporting that switching between tools kills their productivity. It’s not just annoying — 44% said the constant context switching causes significant loss of focus.

Making matters worse, 62% of engineers said their organization’s tools aren’t even properly integrated into their workflows.

All of this has tech leaders worried. Two-thirds of the leaders say they’re concerned about keeping their engineering talent from walking out the door.

“There’s is a little bit in the survey about retention, and that managers, leaders themselves are concerned about retention of top talent,” Kirkland said. “We invest a lot in our best and brightest, and losing any one of those for various reasons — every single one of those hurts, it sets us back. … “As engineering leaders, it’s important for us to retain that talent.”

Indeed, Kirkland said Chainguard is hiring new engineers at a rapid pace.

“We’re adding engineers who have AI expertise. Being able to efficiently and accurately prompt and explain intent to an AI is more important than ever,” he said. “Now that’s a key part of the job interview process here.”

## AI Is Helping, but It’s Complicated

Here’s where things get interesting. [AI and automation](https://thenewstack.io/unlocking-operational-excellence-with-ai-and-automation/) are starting to make a real dent in the problem — but the picture is more complex than the hype suggests.

About 65% of organizations have automated most common engineering tasks, from writing code to handling admin work. And it’s working: among engineers who heavily use automation, 94% say they spend most of their time on energizing work. That compares to just 67% for those who don’t automate much of their daily tasks.

Most engineers (89%) say AI saves them at least three hours a week, with 28% reclaiming up to six hours.

But there’s a trust gap. More than 40% of respondents cited accountability, security, and privacy concerns as barriers to wider AI adoption. And here’s a telling disconnect: 55% of tech leaders say their engineers are encouraged to use AI, but only 46% of engineers feel that same support.

Even more surprising, one in five respondents said AI is not allowed at all where they work. Kirkland said he found that “a little bit shocking.” These engineers are likely in government agencies and regulated industries.

The survey also flagged the rise of “shadow AI” — engineers using unapproved tools on their own to try to get work done faster.

## What Comes Next: AI Agents

Kirkland thinks the next big shift will be AI agents that can handle problems autonomously, working in the background while engineers sleep.

“We’re pretty good at getting [ChatGPT](https://thenewstack.io/openai-launches-new-chatgpt-interface-designed-for-coding/) to generate straw man code, write some documentation,” he said. “But the idea of coding that up into an agent that’s automatically taking input, spitting out output, reworking things in the background while we sleep — that’s the next big phase.”

The economics make sense, too. Why pay an engineer $100,000 a year to babysit maintenance tasks when an AI agent could do it for $10,000 in cloud costs? “I’ll make that investment all day, every day,” Kirkland said, “and then put that $100K engineer onto more valuable work.”

At Chainguard, they call their automation efforts “the factory” — a mix of traditional automation and newer AI-powered systems using [Claude](https://thenewstack.io/claude-code-user-base-grows-300-as-anthropic-launches-enterprise-analytics-dashboard/), [Gemini](https://thenewstack.io/gemini-cli-googles-challenge-to-ai-terminal-apps-like-warp/), and ChatGPT. The company is betting big on this approach, rapidly investing in ways to let AI handle more of the grunt work.

Kirkland’s phrase for it is to “get AI to do the dishes, to leave me more time for creative pursuits.”

## Humans Still Required

Despite all this automation talk, Kirkland doesn’t think AI is replacing engineers anytime soon. Chainguard is actually expanding its engineering team significantly next year.

“There is still a very, very clear and present need for human experts to drive the AI automation and to guide and prompt that AI automation,” he said. The company even tests candidates on their ability to effectively prompt AI during job interviews.

“If you’ve got good fundamentals, you’re going to be able to prompt ever-smarter AIs to do even more powerful things,” Kirkland said.

## The Path Forward

The survey suggests a clear opportunity for organizations: Combine AI and automation with better, more integrated tools to shift engineers from maintenance to innovation. When that happens, engineers stay engaged, organizations ship faster, and everyone benefits.

“At Chainguard, we believe that the experience engineers have within their organizations goes hand in hand with innovation and security,” Kirkland said. “When engineers are weighed down by toil and technical debt, it doesn’t just slow innovation; it creates security risks.”

The 2026 Engineering Reality Report surveyed 600 software engineers and 600 senior technology leaders across the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France in August 2025.
