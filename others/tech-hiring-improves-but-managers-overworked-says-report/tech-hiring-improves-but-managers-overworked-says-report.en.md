First, the bad news: half of all companies represented in a new survey experienced either a layoff or a hiring freeze in the past 12 months.

Now, the good: that’s an improvement over the 67% that said the same a year ago, according to the new study by LeadDev.

More survey participants said their organization’s IT headcount is increasing (36%) than said it is decreasing (30%).

For managers, though, the situation is less promising. In the 2025 report, 22% said their organizations had added managerial roles — while a higher share, 28%, reported a decrease.

[“The LeadDev Engineering Leadership Report 2025”](https://leaddev.com/the-engineering-leadership-report-2025) was conducted in March, with results based on 617 engineering professionals. Fifty percent of respondents were from Europe, while 34% were from the United States. Forty percent of respondents work at organizations with at least 1,000 employees.

## Nearly Half of Those Surveyed Facing Burnout

Developers and their managers are also under increasing pressure on the job, according to the new study.

* Fifty-two percent of the engineering managers surveyed have taken on more direct reports in the last year.
* Forty-eight percent of tech leads with no management responsibility report working more hours as compared to a year ago.

This situation may be having an impact on morale: Forty percent of respondents overall said they believe their team members are less motivated to come to work than they were 12 months ago, a warning sign of [burnout](https://thenewstack.io/10-new-jobs-for-burned-out-software-developers/).

In fact, 46% of respondents reported conditions that indicated critical to moderate levels of burnout. Only 21% — just over one in five survey participants — could be categorized as “healthy” based on the symptoms they reported.

Perhaps it is no surprise, then, that 60% of managers said they are considering transitioning back to an [individual contributor role](https://thenewstack.io/tech-works-how-to-get-promoted-without-becoming-a-manager/).

## AI’s Impact: Overrated?

The report dug into the impact of AI on [headcount](https://thenewstack.io/ai-will-steal-developer-jobs-but-not-how-you-think/) and [productivity](https://thenewstack.io/the-field-cto-view-ai-vibe-coding-and-developer-skillsets/) — and found that, at least so far, [both the anxieties about AI as a job killer and as a development superpower](https://thenewstack.io/developer-productivity-in-2025-more-ai-but-mixed-results/) are more based on speculation than reality.

For instance: Only 9% of participants in this year’s survey reported that headcount at their organization is being reduced in 2025 because of generative AI. And only 4% said they see an increase in jobs that they can attribute to GenAI.

And at least so far, that’s unlikely to change. Fifty-four percent of respondents said they do not think generative AI will impact headcount in 2025; another 36% didn’t know what the impact would be.

However, respondents are concerned about AI’s impact on junior developers trying to enter and grow in the industry. In 2025, 54% were concerned about this issue, up from 43% in last year’s survey.

Meanwhile, the survey results indicated that the hype driving the AI boom — that it significantly speeds up productivity — isn’t being matched by real-world results. In the new report,

Sixty percent said they do not believe AI has significantly boosted their team’s productivity. And only 6% said they have seen a game-changing leap in productivity because of GenAI tools.
