From the boardroom to the break room, AI is the hot topic of 2025. Yet somewhere between the executive vision and ground-level implementation, the transformative potential of AI gets diluted. While C-suite leaders champion “AI-first” initiatives, a cascade of questions — from procurement about budgets, security about compliance and hesitant end users about privacy, job security and more — reveals a fundamental disconnect.

The good news is that there’s a path forward. We can look to enterprise implementations for other groundbreaking technological advances to guide how to look at AI transformation. Taking inspiration from these experiences, here are four essential pillars that support [successful enterprise AI implementation](https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-agents-will-transform-devops-workflows-for-engineers) where both shareholders and individual contributors (ICs) can find tangible value.

## 1. Set the Tone
When organizations set a frantic pace for adoption with zero room for failure, they also set themselves up with zero room for innovation. Therefore, they see less value from whatever initiative they’re working on.

AI is no different. For something as earth-shattering as AI to enter mainstream use in an organization, everyone has to be aligned and on board to offer room for experimentation and demonstrating wins.

Every person, across all levels of the organization, has a role to play to make this a success.

**Leadership level:**Create a clear AI vision that outlines business outcomes and success metrics. Make AI-first part of your culture and lead by example. Highlight and reward teams showing success (and learning from failure).**Manager level:**Develop team-specific AI implementation roadmaps that align with the broader organizational strategy. Offer opportunities to brainstorm, share wins and troubleshoot roadblocks. Have a strategy for reporting team progress out to the wider organization.**IC level:**Create and execute AI experiments that drive toward business outcomes. Document practical use cases where AI has been valuable. Socialize the results across your team and adjacent ones.
Building on this foundation of shared understanding, organizations can address the practical aspects of AI implementation.

## 2. Outline Tooling Needs and Cost
Many enterprises stumble by treating AI tools as one-size-fits-all solutions, or they overbuy AI tools that deliver empty promises with low internal adoption. Sometimes shadow AI — AI tools that creep into a tool stack without routine approvals — can proliferate, allowing handy but “forbidden” tools to worm their way in. Without [proper assessment](https://thenewstack.io/six-ways-ai-is-upending-the-devops-lifecycle/) of departmental needs and existing workflows, organizations risk making their AI stack an expensive and unproductive mess.

Here are some considerations to prevent this from happening:

**Leadership level:**Establish a comprehensive AI budget that includes training, infrastructure and ongoing maintenance costs. Listen to the needs of each department and keep your practitioners in mind.**Manager level:**Conduct detailed workflow analyses to identify where AI can provide the most immediate value. Dedicate time and resources to vetting solutions. Take team needs and preferences into account while maintaining business-level criteria for vendors.**IC level:**Suggest tooling options. Engage in vendor evaluation processes. Provide feedback on integration with daily workflows. Work with the vendor to ensure that the AI works as well in production as it sounds on paper.
With the right tools in place, organizations can hit the ground running with a tech stack that fits their needs.

## 3. Set Guardrails and Understand Failure Responses
AI systems, like any technology, can fail. Organizations that don’t prepare for these scenarios risk security breaches, compliance violations and loss of trust. Understanding and planning for failure modes is crucial.

Be ready for anything with a multifaceted approach to AI-related failures.

**Leadership level:**Develop clear[AI governance policies](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/ai/learn/ai-governance/)that align with regulatory requirements and ethical guidelines. Create a culture where failure is inevitable, though learning from it is mandatory.**Manager level:**Practice incidents with the team to ensure that the team understands roles, escalations and remediations so they’re ready in the case of a real failure. Set aside time for your team to create runbooks and update documentation.**IC level:**Establish monitoring on critical dependencies. Report edge cases and unexpected behaviors to improve system reliability. Know which teams own which parts of your AI implementation and strategy. Have those roles mapped in your incident management platform.
What you do during failure is important. What you do after a failure can be even more valuable.

## 4. Learn, Improve and Implement
Without post-incident reviews and feedback loops, AI initiatives can become costly experiments with unclear benefits. Organizations need structured approaches to reviewing incidents or highlighting [areas for improvement](https://thenewstack.io/empowering-it-teams-through-seamless-ui-and-ai-agents/). This can be time-consuming, detailed work, but everyone needs to champion it for improvements to stick. This includes:

**Leadership level:**Establish organization-wide post-incident review processes. Determine ways for AI users to highlight inefficiencies. Earmark capacity for implementing changes that make the system more resilient and rewarding.**Manager or IC level:**Implement regular review cycles to assess AI performance and team adoption. Encourage reading, writing and sharing post-incident reviews within and across teams to build a culture of learning. Set aside cycles for the team to implement changes.
The path to AI success isn’t a sprint. It’s a marathon that requires sustained effort across all levels of the organization.

## Embracing the AI Journey Together
AI transformation is truly a team sport. Success requires everyone from the C-suite to front-line workers to play their part and contribute their unique perspectives. By following these four pillars, organizations can move beyond the hype and create lasting value with AI.
