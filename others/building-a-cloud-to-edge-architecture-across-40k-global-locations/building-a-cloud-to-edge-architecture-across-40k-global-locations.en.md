Edge at any kind of distributed scale requires new management approaches that account for [edge idiosyncrasies](https://thenewstack.io/edge-computing/), like poor connectivity, limited hardware or lack of onsite technical support.

But those concerns don’t absolve enterprise IT teams who are under constant pressure to maintain reliable, consistent digital services across the company’s footprint, no matter how large, disbursed or problematic. After all, the digital experience is so closely tied to customer satisfaction, operational excellence and business goals that [maintaining those services](https://thenewstack.io/ebooks/kubernetes/running-virtual-machines-on-kubernetes-a-practical-guide-for-enterprise-migrations/) is the No.1 responsibility of many enterprise IT teams.

Achieving this level of service across thousands (or tens of thousands) of locations is a huge challenge, as YUM! Brands, parent company of global restaurant chains Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut and Habitat Burger, discovered. The solution, it found, is a modular, container-based and edge-native architecture that standardizes digital operations across its 40,000+ global stores.
