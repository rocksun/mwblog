Picture this: It’s the night before a major software release and you are sitting there reflecting on the project, and asking yourself, “How did we even make it here?” Amid challenges like ambiguous project requirements and priorities, too much time spent retroactively fixing issues and a difficult relationship with outsourced team members, it feels like a miracle that you even made it to this final stage. Could better communication have prevented all of these problems and hurdles? Most likely.
[Studies show](https://www.statista.com/topics/1900/it-outsourcing/) that 50% of outsourced projects fall short of client expectations, and 30% of that is due to bad communication, which can affect everything from writing code to conducting meetings to developing strong relationships between teams. So, how can you overcome this challenge to ensure the seamless success of your [next outsourced project](https://thenewstack.io/preventing-scope-creep-guide-for-managing-outsourced-teams/)? Here are seven approaches companies can adopt.
**1. Start With a Clear Understanding of the Project**
Transparent communication starts with a mutual understanding of the work that needs to be done. Both the client and development teams (internal and outsourced) must have a shared understanding of scope, objectives, requirements, processes and tools that will lead them to success. Open, honest conversations during a project’s kickoff will help avoid misunderstandings and put all teams in a position to deliver.
**2. Establish Code Quality Standards**
Software is only as strong as the code behind it. Teams must
[write high-quality code](https://thenewstack.io/its-no-longer-about-how-you-write-code-but-how-you-operate-it/) to achieve their goals, and that means executing on clearly laid-out and mutually agreed upon standards. Consistent code increases readability and maintainability. As a result, developers will be better able to understand pieces of code and modify them as needed. This also reduces the likelihood of bugs and defects through early detection and correction, decreasing tech debt overall. [Code reviews](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/code-review/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newstack&utm_campaign=ss-automated-code-review24&utm_content=media-outsourced-projects-240416-&utm_term=&s_category=Organic&s_source=External%Referral&s_origin=newstack) with a reference point for evaluation and improvement promote consistency, which culminates in more robust, scalable and adaptable software. This also makes it easier to onboard new developers and ultimately delivers stronger software. Establishing clear standards will ensure everyone is aligned and can contribute to the creation of lasting, successful software projects.
**3. Reinforce Set Standards**
It’s not enough to just define and communicate about code quality standards. Teams must take action to reinforce that developers are following them. Early detection is crucial in productivity and efficiency; challenges can be identified early and addressed without escalating delays.
While issues are inevitable in any project,

Transparent communication during the earliest stages of [software development can help a team](https://thenewstack.io/managing-software-development-team-dynamics-from-within/) more quickly assess and address issues, preventing further delays down the road.
**4. Foster Better Feedback Loops**
Feedback-driven continuous improvement allows teams to support smoother,
[more efficient CI/CD procedures](https://thenewstack.io/ci-cd/). Not only does it accelerate the development cycle, but it also supports the longevity and performance of the software. This also reduces the risk of post-deployment failure, and gives teams the agility to respond to evolving requirements.
A culture of transparent, constructive feedback across internal and outsourced teams also nurtures a better sense of ownership. Clear and open communication allows for honest feedback on completed projects that can be used to adapt how things are done in the future, improving the quality and timeliness of overall delivery.
**5. Leverage Reporting as a Monitoring Tool**
Developers understand that progress updates are crucial, particularly in an outsourced development business model. Management and client teams need full insight into how a project is going in the event of challenges or adjustments to the initial plan. Transparency builds trust and fosters timely feedback to keep everyone aligned.
Regular reporting meetings and real-time updates help everyone keep a finger on the pulse of a project. Pairing this with the implementation of a solution that empowers continuous development of clean (consistent, intentional, adaptable and responsible) code helps offer transparency into quality, security and the overall health of the codebase. This way, potential roadblocks or delays can be quickly identified so teams can proactively adjust to ensure their success.
**6. Ensure Proactive Risk Management**
Proactive risk management is important, and it can’t be done without transparent communication. Encourage conversation about potential difficulties during a project’s earliest stages, identify standards to meet (PCI, OWASP, etc.) and collaborate on contingency plans. Keep the conversation going, updating risk assessment as needed throughout the life cycle of a project. A proactive and continuous
[approach to risk management](https://thenewstack.io/managing-cloud-security-risk-posture-through-a-full-stack-approach/) allows internal and outsourced teams to tackle smaller problems before they become major issues and derail timelines.
**7. Create a Culture of Open Communication**
If you didn’t get it already, transparency is the key to effective communication that keeps a project moving. In today’s software-driven landscape, moving outsourced software projects forward is more critical than ever. Transparency is derived from agreed-upon standards, real-time updates, feedback loops and swift risk management. With these strategies, a blended team of internal and outsourced resources can excel at delivering top-quality software.
**Communication Is Essential for Better Software**
Communication can’t be undervalued, especially when it comes to
[outsourced projects](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/reduce-outsourcing-software-development-risk/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=newstack&utm_campaign=ss-outsourcing-software24&utm_content=media-outsourced-projects-240416-&utm_term=&s_category=Organic&s_source=External%Referral&s_origin=newstack), where teams may need to conquer challenges of geography and culture to achieve success. Teams must work together to ensure they can collaborate well and create an environment that sets them up to deliver quality software in a timely manner. Teams that prioritize that commitment to communication while also taking active steps to foster it will reap the benefits. [
