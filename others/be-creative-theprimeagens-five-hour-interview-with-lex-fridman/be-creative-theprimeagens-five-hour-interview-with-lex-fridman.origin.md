It was almost historic: an epic [five-hour interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8) with the programming world’s livestreaming developer sensation, “ThePrimeagen.”

Known for his popular channels [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen/) (plus his quick, lively personality), [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/theprimeagen) (AKA, Michael Paulson) sat for a kind of free-wheeling summit with popular programmer-turned-podcaster, [Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com/).

The rollicking interview quickly attracted 1.4 million views (along with 3,021 comments). ThePrimeagen is a colorful character who pontificated on everything from Rust to metaprogramming and “this weird energy that comes from just having a mustache.”

ThePrimeagen critiquing Stack Overflow’s list of the most popular programming languages. “Why is Assembly more popular than Ruby?”

The two argued over whether SQL is a programming language and the merits of Bash. (“I like it, up until I need an array.”) They discussed why *assert* statements are “super fun,” while ThePrimeagen added that, “Everyone keeps telling me new C++ is great. It has every feature you’ve ever wanted and all the features you *don’t* want…”

But along the way, they also delved into the personal side of his programming story, and the hard road he’s traveled to get there, including the passions that led him to a life of coding, and what keeps him evangelizing about it for his vast but invisible audience.

Somehow, as the conversation progressed, Fridman’s audience saw the real Michael Paulson, revealing all those intimately crucial truths that he’s found on his long programming journey — about the joy of learning, personal redemption and the importance of keeping the programming world just as inclusive as it can be.

Inclusive enough even for fun-loving misfits like himself…

## “A Hell of a Life”
Early on, Fridman joked that, “For people who don’t know who ThePrimeagen is, he mentions the fact that he has been very successful and has worked at Netflix basically every other sentence.”

“Correct,” says the Primeagen. “Almost as much as I mention [Neovim](https://thenewstack.io/neovims-future-could-have-ai-and-brain-computer-interfaces/).”

But then his interviewer said more seriously that Paulson’s “had one hell of a life. And I think it’s inspiring to a lot of people…”

Paulson’s father died when he was seven years old. He’d gravitated toward several unhealthy habits (including pot smoking by the age of 8 and drinking by the age of 15), and towards the end of high school, a suicide attempt. He says on the podcast that, coming out of the hospital, he’d stopped caring altogether. There were more drugs — LSD, mushrooms, meth — and then, college. “That whole period of life was just kind of marked by poor decisions. And then sometime, when I was about 19 years old… I just had this one evening where I felt the very dramatic and real presence of God… ”

Paulson says he felt then that he had to make a choice, and decided, “I don’t like what I’m living.” In the days that followed, when he hurt someone or turned to drugs, he felt ashamed. “All of a sudden, I just had a conscience.” Somewhere under the skies of Montana, he’d tried to become a good student. He spent “hours upon hours” at the math learning center. “And then just at some point, years into this journey… Something clicks.

“All of a sudden, I was the best person at math…”

## Learning and Exploring
Looking back, Paulson saw a moment where learning becomes exploring. He likened it to when a musician suddenly realizes they know how to play an instrument: “It feels amazing.” The desire to do something had transformed into something more, and big parts of Paulson’s life started to change.

Paulson conquered his addictions. He met his future wife. But he’d also discovered that, “I loved programming. I started programming 12 hours a day.” He launched his first startup using PHP. “And I was just so motivated…. Sometimes I’d program for 24 or 36 hours straight… That’s all I wanted to do….

“And that’s kind of like — how I became me.”

It’s not like he never made a mistake. Hired at [Netflix](https://thenewstack.io/from-netflix-to-walmart-open-source-kafka-in-action/), he found it was using the Groovy programming language and had its own custom version of its reactive programming library, including “observables” which broadcast events when they happen. Paulson once tried to pause one temporarily, giving it the sleep command, only to discover two things:

- When a thread sleeps itself, no thread can wake it up.
- His stack wasn’t multithreaded.
“I’d just turned off all of staging,” he said. Making things worse? Since his command wasn’t responding, “I ran it 10 times…

“No developer could work for the rest of the afternoon — because I locked up all the instances!”

ThePrimeagen also has multiple stories of “[breaking production](https://thenewstack.io/qa-erica-brescia-bitnami/)” — but the big question is always what you learned. He went back and read Groovy’s official language reference, and soon he’d become “the person that knew these things.”

So while Netflix had a reputation of being hard on new hires — “Their culture deck was ‘Hire fast, fire fast!'” — Paulson soon began to find his niche: “Being the person that was willing to do the thing that no one else was.”

## Origin Story
It was also at Netflix that his streaming career began, thanks to [Extra Life](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&id=1306), an online charity that raises money for medical research. “You stream,” Paulson explains, “and whatever money you raise, it goes to kids with cancer research.”

It was as simple as that — and one thing led to another. After setting up his system for streaming Fortnite, “I end up really enjoying it…! I keep doing it, and then one day I decide I’m going to do some programming. Because I really love Vim, and I think I’m kind of fast at [Vim](https://thenewstack.io/a-look-at-vim-a-text-editor-for-the-ages/). And maybe people think programming is kind of cool.”

Paulson was one of the first to livestream coding, but he was there on a deeply felt mission.

Paulson borrowed his name *ThePrimeagen* from the last level of his childhood-favorite Nintendo game, [ Turok: Dinosaur Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turok:_Dinosaur_Hunter) (based on a

[1950s comic book series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turok)).
And then years later, he’d found himself wanting to push against how the tech sector had become “this super pretentious place… It was like, ‘We’re building the most sophisticated things, and this is for the *smart* people and everyone else is the *dumb* people. Don’t worry, we’ll design for you, dummy…! We’ll show you how to make the perfect architecture.’

“And I remember changing my Twitter handle because I got so upset — and just went back to my videogame name.” He picked up the mantle and became ThePrimeagen, “because I was like: I want things to be *fun*.”

Paulson told Fridman, “My goal became to destroy whatever that tech mentality was, because it includes nobody. Everyone thinks that they’re the smart people, and they design for the dummies… I want tech to be this place where people feel like they can be creative, and excited, and actually build something. And if you’re new, it’s okay to be dumb and ask dumb questions…”

Somewhere, his life experience had given him a deep empathy. “No one’s expecting you to be smart. Pick whatever you want — like, actually *do* something and have fun and build your crazy ideas.

“Oh, you’re going to reinvent the wheel? Reinvent the wheel, understand what you’re doing, learn it really good, and interact and stuff!”

A year ago, he finally decided to leave his long-time home at Netflix and became a full-time streamer, and “I guess I haven’t looked back.” In that year, he’s added 130,000 more subscribers to his YouTube channel — a 38% increase — while an additional 260,000 followers watch him on Twitch. But most importantly, said ThePrimeagen, “It’s just been a lot of fun!” And “people really enjoy watching and engaging…”

He now has 473,000 subscribers to [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen) — but it’s all been a solitary effort. “It’s not like it was at Netflix, where I could hear about stuff people are building… ” Paulson says working as part of a team is “something that I really do miss… that forced, hard problem-solving together.”

## Looking Ahead
Through it all, he seems to be telling young programmers to remember the joy. Even in a world where AI is becoming increasingly powerful, “I still want my kids to learn how to program… if that’s a good enough answer.”

During the interview, he seemed like he was having a lot of fun. He pronounced SQL as “Squeal.” And inevitably, WSL, Microsoft’s Windows Subsystem for Linux, then becomes “Weasel.” And before it was over, they’d revisited his all-time favorite project: porting an ASCII-art version of Doom to the web and then [letting people control it using commands typed on Twitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f9tbqSIm-E).

ThePrimeagen shared what he’s learned from his experiences with ADHD, like the joy of being able to focus on programming and the benefits of supportive family. (“Maybe I found a cheat code: a loving wife.”) He explained why doomscrolling makes you anxious and the importance of fighting distractions. But most of all, he candidly shared what *not* to do, and some hard-won pieces of wisdom from the voice of experience.

Did he have any advice for young programmers? ThePrimeagen looked back over his own experience and saw a bad example. When it came to programming, “I became enamored and addicted.”

And this had led to programming “for way too many hours — forgetting to spend the time I needed with my wife, with my friends, all that stuff…” This led ThePrimagen to admit a hard truth: “I think — though it made me who I am — it was probably an unhealthy activity and probably not a wise activity.”

So what would he say to young programmers? First, “You got to develop the love, the skill, the desire for it… whatever that flavor is that’s going to get you coming back every single day. ‘Getting the reps in the gym,’ if you will, for programming.”

But there’s a second part to his advice. “Also knowing how to value what is valuable — and not getting ‘lost in the sauce,’ where you’re just so stuck on trying to make the next greatest startup that you sacrifice your health, you sacrifice your relationships.

“Or even worse, you sacrifice your own morals to take certain shortcuts that you probably shouldn’t be taking in life to be able to achieve these things.”

And as their five-hour discussion came to an end, Fridman closed out the show with the perfect quote from Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho.

“When we strive to become better than we are — everything around us becomes better, too.”
