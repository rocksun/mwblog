While the good intent of the term “citizen developer” is meant to empower anyone, not just professional coders, to create powerful software solutions — it has outlived its usefulness. Continuing to use it risks undermining the very value it was meant to highlight. Successful [software development](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-find-success-with-code-reviews/) in today’s enterprise environment is not about a division between “citizens” and “coders.” Instead, it thrives on constant collaboration between business and IT. Business users bring vision and requirements, while IT provides technical expertise and execution. This partnership transforms development into a collaborative spectrum of skills, where business and IT are equally invested in the outcome.

It’s time we updated our [language to reflect this new reality by moving](https://thenewstack.io/dart-frog-a-frontend-language-moves-to-the-backend/) away from the term “citizen developer.” This shift in terminology is more than just semantics — it shapes culture, expectations, and, ultimately, the success of innovation.

## The Problem with ‘Citizen Developer’
The term “citizen developer” implies a division, relegating these individuals to “helpers” rather than recognizing them as equal contributors in the app development process. Today’s workplaces don’t neatly fit into “coder” and “non-coder” categories; business expertise is as essential to [software development as technical skills](https://thenewstack.io/5-software-development-skills-ai-will-render-obsolete/).

By emphasizing an “either-or” approach, the term “citizen developer” risks pinning IT and business against one another, making it seem as though projects are either fully IT-led or business-led. In reality, any successful enterprise development project is a collaboration.

Developers need insights from non-developers to shape applications that meet end-user needs effectively. Imagine a data analyst who designs an automation solution to streamline their team’s workflow. They may lack formal coding training, but their deep understanding of the business problem and familiarity with appropriate tools make their contribution invaluable. Labeling them as a “citizen developer” minimizes their impact, implying they are on a different, lesser plane than their IT counterparts. This individual isn’t a “citizen developer,” nor can they be left out of the process —they are experts in solving specific problems, equipped with the tools to bridge business needs and technical execution.

## Low-Code and AI Changed the Landscape
Low-code tools have evolved significantly from their initial purpose of enabling business users to build more straightforward applications. Today’s platforms — especially those enhanced by AI and automation — facilitate powerful collaboration between business users and IT professionals. Business users can leverage generative AI to [create complex application](https://thenewstack.io/dapr-create-applications-faster-with-standardized-apis/) designs, iterate on workflows, and integrate with enterprise systems — all under IT guidance.

In this new landscape, everyone from their area of expertise contributes to app development. IT professionals ensure technical integrity, security, and scalability, while business users provide vital insights into needs and pain points. Together, they share responsibility for successful development; roles can no longer be neatly divided into “technical” versus “non-technical.” Clinging to the term “citizen developer” perpetuates outdated notions of knowledge ownership and execution roles, undermining the true impact of collaborative technology.

## Collaboration and the Rise of Fusion Teams
So, what does effective collaboration look like today? Enter the concept of “fusion teams.” In this structure, roles are defined not by coding ability but by expertise in business needs, technical architecture, user experience, and process optimization. Business professionals contribute more than ideas — they actively build and refine applications using low-code platforms or create fully functional app designs while IT ensures compliance and stability.

Consider the development of a customer service automation tool. On a fusion team, a business expert might draft workflows that make sense from a service delivery perspective while a [developer sets up the backend](https://thenewstack.io/backend-development-efficiency-the-critical-role-of-caching/) structure. Each role is critical; they work together to produce a valuable product. Referring to the business expert as a “citizen developer” misses the point — they are co-creators contributing unique insights toward a shared goal. By shedding this label, we embrace the holistic approach of fusion teams in building better software faster.

## Empowering All Contributors
When we stop referring to business users as “citizen developers,” we change our terminology and our narrative about collaboration in enterprise IT. Inclusive terms like “business technologist” or “low-code developer” better reflect these individuals’ knowledge and expertise. They are technologists focused on solving specific business problems using available tech tools.

Emerging certifications and formal roles — such as “business developer” or “process automation analyst” — signal that these paths are legitimate and respected within technology. Moving beyond “citizen developer,” organizations can open new avenues for [career development while accurately reflecting skill](https://thenewstack.io/recruiters-speak-top-skills-devs-need-for-ai-cloud-jobs/) diversity within teams.

## Language as a Catalyst for Innovation
When we define roles clearly and inclusively, we empower individuals and encourage collaboration across all levels of an organization. By unifying “business” and “technical” roles under terms that reflect modern app development realities, we foster a workplace culture where every contributor feels integral to the process. This cultural shift catalyzes innovation, enabling teams to combine their unique skills in agile, meaningful ways.

As development becomes more democratized through low-code platforms and AI tools, inclusive language becomes essential for sustaining a culture of openness and creativity. By embracing collaborative terminology that reflects shared contributions from business and IT professionals, we pave the way for more successful enterprise IT projects.

Please, let’s move beyond outdated labels like “citizen developer” and embrace a collaborative future where business and IT work hand-in-hand as partners in innovation. By recognizing every contributor’s role as vital in this process, we can drive more effective outcomes for our organizations — and ultimately deliver better solutions that meet real-world needs.
