[WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://thenewstack.io/webassembly/webassembly-what-beginners-need-to-know/) has emerged as a game-changer in the world of web development. By providing a compact binary format that runs at near-native speed, WebAssembly enables developers to build high-performance applications that were previously unimaginable in the browser.
Its versatility and efficiency have made Wasm a go-to tool for solving a wide range of challenges in modern web development. In this article, we’ll explore the top five uses of WebAssembly for web developers, complete with practical examples and code snippets to help you get started.

## Why Use WebAssembly for Performance Optimization?
First and foremost, devs love WebAssembly because it’s designed to execute at near-native speed, making it ideal for computationally intensive tasks.

Not to mention, it’s extremely malleable and portable. Code written in languages like C, C++, or Rust can be compiled to WebAssembly and run in any modern browser, without requiring platform-specific modifications. You can [even convert Python code](https://thenewstack.io/python-and-webassembly-elevating-performance-for-web-apps/#:~:text=There%20are%20several%20compilers%20available,Python%20through%20the%20CPython%20interpreter.), which is already being done [in apps using object character recognition](https://apryse.com/blog/ocr-in-python).

Interoperability: WebAssembly modules can be seamlessly integrated with JavaScript, allowing you to incrementally optimize parts of your application without rewriting the entire codebase.

Not to mention, you won’t have to be an unpaid beta tester if you are to try Wasm. The approach has already been tried and tested, as seen in the following examples.

**Cryptography**: Libraries like Sodium[can be compiled into WebAssembly](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.js)to provide fast and secure cryptographic operations in the browser. This enables encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and key exchange to be performed efficiently on the client side, reducing the need for server-based cryptographic computations while enhancing privacy and security.**Data visualization**: Tools like[D3.js](https://gist.github.com/ColinEberhardt/6ceb7ca74aabac9c8534d7120d31b382)or Plotly[leverage WebAssembly to handle large datasets](https://community.plotly.com/t/long-term-plan-for-how-dash-fits-in-with-webassembly/63696)and complex transformations more efficiently. Once you offload heavy computations to WebAssembly, these libraries can render intricate visualizations, process real-time data streams, and perform complex statistical operations without significant performance degradation.**Scientific computing**: WebAssembly[enables researchers to run simulations and analyses directly in the browser](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.03982), reducing the need for server-side processing. The combination reduces reliance on server-side processing, improves responsiveness, and allows for interactive computational tools that can run entirely on the client side, benefiting fields like physics, bioinformatics, and financial modeling.
## 1. High-Performance Computation in the Browser
One of the most compelling use cases for WebAssembly is offloading computationally intensive tasks to the browser. JavaScript, while versatile, is [not always the best choice for heavy number-crunching](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23500772/math-inaccuracy-in-javascript-safe-to-use-js-for-important-stuff) or complex algorithms.

WebAssembly, on the other hand, is designed to deliver near-native performance, making it ideal for tasks like data processing, simulations, and machine learning.

For example, consider a scenario [where you need to perform matrix multiplication](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/media/31960/download?attachment) — a common operation in graphics rendering or machine learning. Here’s how you might implement it in WebAssembly using C:

1234567891011121314 |
// matrix_multiply.c#include <stdint.h>void matrix_multiply(int32_t* result, const int32_t* matrix_a, const int32_t* matrix_b, int size) { for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < size; j++) { int32_t sum = 0; for (int k = 0; k < size; k++) { sum += matrix_a[i * size + k] * matrix_b[k * size + j]; } result[i * size + j] = sum; } }} |
Afterwards, compile this C code to WebAssembly using Emscripten:
1 |
emcc matrix_multiply.c -O3 -o matrix_multiply.js -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS='["_matrix_multiply"]' -s EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS='["ccall", "cwrap"]' |
Then, call it from JavaScript:
12345678910 |
const wasmModule = await import('./matrix_multiply.js');const matrixMultiply = wasmModule.cwrap('matrix_multiply', null, ['number', 'number', 'number', 'number']);const size = 4;const matrixA = new Int32Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]);const matrixB = new Int32Array([17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]);const result = new Int32Array(size * size);matrixMultiply(result.byteOffset, matrixA.byteOffset, matrixB.byteOffset, size);console.log(result); // Output: [250, 260, 270, 280, 618, 644, 670, 696, ...] |
This approach allows you to leverage the raw power of WebAssembly for computationally expensive tasks, while still maintaining seamless integration with JavaScript.
## 2. Porting Existing Applications to the Web
WebAssembly makes it possible to bring [existing applications written in languages like C](https://developer.fermyon.com/wasm-languages/c-lang), C++, or Rust to the web without requiring a complete rewrite. This is particularly useful for legacy applications or libraries that need to be modernized for web-based deployment.

Let’s say you have a C++ application for image processing. If you compile it to WebAssembly, you can run it directly in the browser. Here’s a simple example of a C++ function [that applies a grayscale filter to an image](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59560881/gray-scale-images-processing-in-c):

123456789101112131415 |
// grayscale.cpp#include <emscripten.h>extern "C" { EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE void grayscale(uint8_t* pixels, int width, int height) { for (int i = 0; i < width * height * 4; i += 4) { uint8_t r = pixels[i]; uint8_t g = pixels[i + 1]; uint8_t b = pixels[i + 2]; uint8_t gray = (r + g + b) / 3; pixels[i] = pixels[i + 1] = pixels[i + 2] = gray; } }} |
Once you’re done, you can compile it with Emscripten:
1 |
emcc grayscale.cpp -O3 -o grayscale.js -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS='["_grayscale"]' -s EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS='["ccall", "cwrap"]' |
Then, use it in JavaScript:
123456789 |
const wasmModule = await import('./grayscale.js');const grayscale = wasmModule.cwrap('grayscale', null, ['number', 'number', 'number']);const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');const imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);grayscale(imageData.data.byteOffset, canvas.width, canvas.height);ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0); |
This approach allows you to reuse existing codebases and bring powerful desktop-grade applications to the web.
## 3. Enhancing Ecommerce Platforms
Ecommerce platforms can benefit significantly from WebAssembly, particularly [when it comes to improving performance](https://thenewstack.io/step-by-step-guide-to-using-webassembly-for-faster-web-apps/) and user experience. For example, product customization tools, [such as 3D configurators or real-time image editors](https://blog.pixelfreestudio.com/how-to-combine-webgl-with-webassembly-for-powerful-3d-apps/), often require heavy computation. With the help of WebAssembly, you can ensure that these tools run smoothly, even on lower-end devices.

Imagine an ecommerce site where users can customize a product, such as a pair of sneakers, by selecting different colors and materials. Rendering these changes in real time can be computationally expensive. With WebAssembly, [you can offload the rendering logic](https://blog.pixelfreestudio.com/the-impact-of-webassembly-on-web-performance-optimization/) to achieve seamless interactivity.

With that in mind, let’s take a look at a simplified example of how you might use WebAssembly to handle image processing for a product customizer:

12345678910 |
// image_processor.rs#[no_mangle]pub fn apply_filter(image_data: &mut [u8], width: u32, height: u32) { for y in 0..height { for x in 0..width { let index = ((y * width + x) * 4) as usize; image_data[index] = 255 - image_data[index]; // Invert colors } }} |
Compile this Rust code to WebAssembly:
1 |
rustc --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -O image_processor.rs |
Then, use it in your JavaScript code to process images in real time:
123 |
const imageData = new Uint8Array([...]); // Image data from canvasconst wasmModule = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch('image_processor.wasm'));wasmModule.exports.apply_filter(imageData, width, height); |
This approach ensures that your ecommerce platform delivers a smooth and engaging user experience.
## 4. Cross-Platform Development
WebAssembly is not limited to the web; [it can also be used for cross-platform development](https://codezup.com/webassembly-cross-platform-development/). By compiling your code to WebAssembly, you can create applications that run consistently across different environments, including browsers, servers, and even edge devices. This makes Wasm tailor-made [for everything from business surveillance](https://www.deepsentinel.com/business/) to sensors.

We can use the example of a hypothetical machine learning model written in Python that you want to deploy both on a server and in the browser. By converting the model to WebAssembly, you can ensure that it runs efficiently in both environments. This is particularly useful for AI-driven applications, where consistency and performance are critical.

Here’s a brief example of how you might [use WebAssembly to run a simple AI model in the browser](https://blog.pixelfreestudio.com/how-to-use-webassembly-for-machine-learning-in-the-browser/):

1234 |
# model.pydef predict(input_data): # AI model logic here return result |
Convert this Python code to WebAssembly using a tool like Pyodide:
1234567 |
const pyodide = await loadPyodide();await pyodide.loadPackage('numpy');pyodide.runPython(` from model import predict result = predict([1, 2, 3])`);console.log(result); |
This approach allows you to leverage the power of AI in your web applications without sacrificing performance.
## 5. Improving Developer Tools
WebAssembly is also [transforming the way developer tools are built and used](https://webassembly.org/docs/tooling/). In particular, code editors, linters and compilers can benefit from the performance boost that WebAssembly provides. When running these tools directly in the browser, you can create more responsive and feature-rich development environments.

A great example of this is the [use of WebAssembly in online IDEs](https://thenewstack.io/the-rise-of-rust-and-webassembly-in-web-development/) like Replit or CodeSandbox. These platforms use WebAssembly to run compilers and interpreters in the browser, enabling developers to write, compile, and debug code without leaving their browsers.

Here’s a simple example of how you might [use WebAssembly to run a code linter in the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly):

123456 |
// linter.rs#[no_mangle]pub fn lint_code(code: &str) -> bool { // Linting logic here true} |
Compile this Rust code to WebAssembly and integrate it into your web-based IDE:
1234 |
const code = "function foo() { return 42; }";const wasmModule = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch('linter.wasm'));const isCodeValid = wasmModule.exports.lint_code(code);console.log(isCodeValid); // Output: true or false |
This approach ensures that your developer tools are both powerful and accessible.
