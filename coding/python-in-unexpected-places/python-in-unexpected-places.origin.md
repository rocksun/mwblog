Everyone knows [Python](https://thenewstack.io/python/) is everywhere in [web development](https://thenewstack.io/web-development-trends-in-2024-a-shift-back-to-simplicity/). Netflix, Instagram, and Dropbox all rely on it. But Python doesn’t just live in [web apps](https://thenewstack.io/step-by-step-guide-to-using-webassembly-for-faster-web-apps/). Python, and its libraries and frameworks, quietly run things in some pretty unexpected places.

In this post, I want to show you some of the weirder, cooler, and less obvious spots where Python is doing heavy lifting. From controlling [Mars rovers](https://thenewstack.io/nasa-programmer-remembers-debugging-lisp-in-deep-space/) to helping archaeologists dig up the past, Python’s role is way broader than most people realize. If you’ve ever thought programming was just about websites, this might change your mind. Python is everywhere and that’s pretty exciting.

## NASA’s Mars Rover
Fine, Python isn’t on the actual Rover, but it still plays a major role in the mission. Teams at [NASA](https://thenewstack.io/nasas-thirst-for-open-source-software-and-for-open-science/) use it to plan safe routes across Mars by calculating paths through tricky terrain. It helps process the flood of images and sensor data the rover sends back, making it easier to spot hazards or interesting geological features. Scientists use Python to visualize that data fast, so they can make decisions on the fly. Before sending any commands, engineers simulate rover actions in Python to catch potential issues ahead of time. It’s the glue between planning, analysis, and visualization, turning raw data into real insights that keep the mission moving.

Libraries and frameworks:

**NumPy and SciPy**: Perform complex numerical calculations for trajectory planning and data analysis.**Matplotlib**: Provides visualization tools to help scientists explore and understand rover data quickly.**NASA-built simulation tools**: Custom Python-based software that simulates rover commands and mission scenarios to test and validate operations before deployment.
## CERN: High-Energy Physics Meets High-Level Language
[CERN](https://thenewstack.io/kueue-can-now-schedule-kubernetes-batch-jobs-across-clusters/) runs massive experiments like those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which generate petabytes of data every year. Physicists analyze this data to uncover the fundamental particles and forces of the universe.
Python handles many tasks behind the scenes at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider experiments. Python plays a vital role at CERN by powering data processing, experiment control, rapid prototyping, and visualization. It helps transform billions of raw particle collisions into manageable data sets, enables scientists to monitor and adjust detectors in real time, and lets physicists quickly test new scientific models without lengthy compile times. Python also supports exploring and presenting complex data through clear visualizations, speeding up discovery and insight.

Libraries and Frameworks:

**PyROOT**: A Python interface to CERN’s ROOT framework, allowing high-performance data analysis with Python while leveraging C++ speed.**NumPy**: Provides efficient handling of large numerical arrays and mathematical functions used in data manipulation.**Pandas:**Offers powerful data structures and tools to organize and analyze tabular data.**matplotlib**: Enables detailed plotting and visualization of experiment results**Gaudi**: CERN’s modular framework for experiment control and data processing, with Python bindings for scripting and automation.
## Industrial Robots: Real-Time Control and Monitoring
Python controls and monitors industrial robots in real-time. It manages robot movement commands to ensure precise and coordinated actions on the factory floor. Python collects and processes sensor data to keep track of robot health and performance. This real-time monitoring helps spot issues quickly, reducing downtime. Python also analyzes sensor trends to predict maintenance needs before failures occur. Overall, Python helps automate operations, improve efficiency, and keep robots running smoothly.

Frameworks and libraries:

**ROS (Robot Operating System) with rospy**: Framework for robot software and communication.**NumPy and SciPy**: Perform real-time calculations and process sensor signals.**pandas**: Organizes and analyzes time-series sensor data for monitoring and maintenance.**matplotlib and Plotly**: Visualize robot performance and detect anomalies on dashboards.
## Film and TV VFX
Python plays a big role in film visual effects by automating repetitive tasks and managing complex workflows. It helps artists and technical teams create and manipulate 3D models, animations, and simulations more efficiently. Python scripts streamline rendering pipelines and integrate different software tools, speeding up the production process. It also processes large amounts of data, like tracking motion or adjusting lighting, to ensure final shots look seamless and polished.

Libraries and frameworks:

**Maya Python API**: Controls 3D modeling and animation in Autodesk Maya.**Nuke Python API**: Automates compositing tasks in Foundry’s Nuke.**NumPy and OpenCV**: Handle image processing and data manipulation.**NumPy and OpenCV**: Handle image processing and data manipulation.
## Earthquake Modeling: Seismic Risk and Simulation
Python helps scientists model earthquakes and assess seismic risk by pulling together huge amounts of geophysical data, running simulations, and visualizing potential outcomes. Researchers use it to process real-time sensor data, map fault lines, and simulate how earthquakes could impact buildings, cities, or regions. It’s also used to test and refine models quickly, which helps in planning and disaster preparedness.

Libraries and frameworks:

**ObsPy**: A toolkit for reading, processing, and visualizing seismological data.**NumPy and SciPy**: Handle numerical modeling and complex calculations.**Matplotlib and Plotly**: Used for visualizing waveforms, hazard maps, and simulation results.**Pandas**: Organizes and analyzes large sets of seismic and structural data.
Yes, Python powers countless websites, but it also helps scientists explore other planets, keeps factories working, models natural disasters, and brings Hollywood’s wildest ideas to life. It’s a behind-the-scenes engine driving some of the most fascinating tech out there. Once you start noticing where Python shows up, you realize it’s not just a web language. It’s part of the real world in a surprisingly physical way.
