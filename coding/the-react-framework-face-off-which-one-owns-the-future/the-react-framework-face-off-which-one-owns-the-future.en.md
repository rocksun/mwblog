Frontend developer and educator [Kent Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) has some good news for [frontend developers](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-frontend-development) confused about which React-based framework to choose.

“For those who are looking for a new framework, you’re starting a new project, you cannot make a wrong choice. All of these frameworks are fabulous,” he told audiences at React Conf, which last week released [videos from the event](https://www.youtube.com/@ReactConfOfficial). “React is doing so much more for us now. The frameworks are really converging, and they really look similar now.”

Dodds joined a panel of framework creators, and one bundler creator, led by Jack Herrington, aka the Blue Collar Coder, to discuss “[What’s The Framework of the React Future?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSEUlS8WcQs)”

Here’s what developers had to say for their frameworks.

## Expo Router

[Evan Bacon](https://github.com/evanbacon), a software engineer and the creator of [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/), spoke on behalf of the opinionated routing framework for React Native.

“We really believe in the beauty and the optimization of the mobile form factor and how much that resonates with real people,” he said. “We were really happy with what we built here, starting with React, … bring[ing] [JavaScript](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-javascript/) and React over to native and now we have file-based routing, server actions, [API](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-api-management/) routes, environment variables, one-click deployments. So it’s just so much good stuff that the web community has innovated, and it’s incredible to bring it over to these new spaces and new form factors.”

Expo is exploring how to support the development of AI applications.

“We want to be a really good tool for helping others build AI tools,” he said. “But like very recursively because … everyone is trying to build something agentic. And so downstream of that, they’re going to reach for a dev tool like Expo.”

## Next.js

[Josh Story](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnoff/), a Vercel engineer who works on the Next.js team, spoke on behalf of the framework. The big change for Next.js was in 2022 when it started working on [App Router](https://thenewstack.io/how-next-js-got-its-snappy-client-navs-back/), which was marked stable in 2023, he noted.

“This is the [React Server Components](https://thenewstack.io/frontend-schism-will-react-server-components-destroy-react/) implementation that’s been stable for a few years now,” Story said. “The journey is not over. There’s something that’s essential in any React project and that’s composition, and today there are still some places where there’s some hard cliffs.”

Story added that since frameworks like Next.js now support server components, he expects to see more libraries on npm that are server components.

“This is going to be possible so that maybe you’ll have authentication libraries or form validation libraries or these kinds of things to just get componentized now and they can be used in any framework,” he said. “That’s what’s really powerful about server components.”

He also said that Next.js is reviewing how to best support [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://thenewstack.io/goodbye-plugins-mcp-is-becoming-the-universal-interface-for-ai/) endpoints for AI.

## Parcel

[Devon Govett](https://github.com/devongovett), a software architect at Adobe, created the [open source Parcel bundler](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel).

“If you have an existing client app and you want to try out server components, for example, and you don’t really want to migrate anything or you don’t want to add SSR [server-side rendering], you just want to…. embed some server components into your app and try it out, a bundler, like Parcel, is an easy way to do that,” he said.

Since Parcel isn’t a framework, he pointed to React Router as a possibility for those seeking a React-based framework.

“I really like what the React Router team is doing actually, where … you can actually swap between different bundlers and React Router’s data mode, which is really cool,” he said. “So if you have bundler-specific plugins or types of things that you want to use with React Router, you can actually do that.”

## Rock (for React Native)

[Michał Pierzchała](https://github.com/thymikee), principal engineer at Callstack, said that [Rock](https://www.callstack.com/open-source/rock), described as “a modular toolkit for teams building React Native apps,” is trying to accomplish two goals. First, the framework team wants to get older React Native community CLI apps on the newest tooling so they can leverage some local and remote caching. Second, the team wants to support native iOS and Android apps in the React Native realm.

“With our Rock Brownfield feature, we allow them to import one file and then just instantiate React Native in their iOS or Android,” he said.

Brownfield development is when a developer wants to add React Native to an existing app developed in native code, such as Swift for iOS or Kotlin for Android, without rewriting the whole app.

## React Router

The framework, originally Remix, was created by [Ryan Florence](https://github.com/ryanflorence) and [Michael Jackson](https://gist.github.com/mjackson). It converged with React Router last year and now the two creators have moved on to work on a different framework. But Dodds uses React Router and advocated for it.

“For React Router, in particular, I really appreciate the dedication of the team. It has a lot of investment from Shopify,” he said.

> “I feel really, really good about where we are from framework perspective now.”  
> **— Kent Dodds, frontend developer and educator**

Dodds acknowledged he’s unique in that he’s only made two or three commits to the framework he’s representing.

“I feel really, really good about where we are from framework perspective now,” he said. “It’s really important for frameworks to take care of their users, and React Router has proven to do that over the last decade.”

In regards to AI, Dodds noted that developers are used to adding chatbots to their applications, but now the situation has reversed: Chatbots actually are adding applications through [MCP-UI](https://thenewstack.io/mcp-ui-aims-to-replace-old-world-websites-with-ai-agent-uis/). He said there’s more room for frameworks to improve and support that dynamic.

“If it does play out to be the case, then every one of these frameworks will want to have some affordances for MCP and serving your app right into that chat experience. Whether it be ChatGPT or Gemini or Claude or whatever, that will be an important part of the future for React frameworks or any web framework,” he said.

## Redwood Software Development Kit (SDK)

[Redwood started as a framework](https://thenewstack.io/redwood-a-javascript-framework-designed-for-startups/) then pivoted to an [SDK](https://thenewstack.io/dev-news-vite-rust-ifies-roc-language-js-framework-sdks/). Redmond co-creator [Peter Pistorius](https://github.com/peterpy) emphasized that the SDK is lightweight, composable and “server-first.”

“I’m not going to tell you to use my framework, because you’re already using it. If you’re using [Vite](https://thenewstack.io/should-you-go-all-in-on-vite-a-risk-vs-reward-analysis/), [Typescript](https://thenewstack.io/typescript-5-9-brings-less-friction-more-features/) and [React](https://thenewstack.io/web-development-in-2025-ais-react-bias-vs-native-web/) [you’re] using Redwood, there’s nothing to learn,” he said.
