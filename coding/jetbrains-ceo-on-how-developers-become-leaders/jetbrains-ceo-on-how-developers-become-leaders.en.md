JetBrains CEO [Kirill Skrygan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirill-skrygan-7b86073a/?originalSubdomain=nl), 38, was all in on tennis — he played and was one of the best in the city of St. Petersburg. But at the ripe age of 10, his parents realized that the funnel of tennis professional begins very wide but quickly narrows for people who want to become professionals. So they took him to a Russian mathematical school, where he learned how to program. He went on to attend St. Petersburg State University, where he became a software engineer.

The Netherlands native began as a junior developer working for American health care companies. In his early 20s, he joined JetBrains as a team lead, eventually moving up to become the CEO of [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/), which specializes in creating integrated development environments (IDEs) such as IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm and WebStorm. He joined the company as a junior developer in 2010.

Skrygan spoke with The New Stack about his journey from junior developer to CEO, and shared his advice for how other developers can make the transition from coders to management.

## Why He Moved to Management

Skrygan is very clear on what brings him purpose in his work, which ultimately lead to him to transition into management.

“What drives me is actually the impact I can bring to the overall technological landscape of the whole [of] humanity,” he said.

He spent 10 years leading the [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) IDE team, where the desktop application developer fell in love with the cross-platform language, [Kotlin](https://thenewstack.io/kotlin-multiplatform-mobile-from-jetbrains-takes-on-flutter/), which was used to create Rider’s frontend.

“I immediately fell in love with [Kotlin because it’s so elegant](https://roadmap.sh/kotlin) and […] so flexible,” Skrygan said. “What amazed me from day one is [that] it could be very strict and enterprise-ish (like Java) on one hand, but on the other hand it might be very, very hipster-ish — like OCaml or Scala, or something like that.”

Then he became the department head across [JetBrain’s IDEs](https://thenewstack.io/ai-and-ides-walking-through-how-jetbrains-is-approaching-ai/), where he managed approximately 650 people.

“You can actually drive the business strategy, product strategy, marketing, everything. I love it,” he said.

But even when developers want to move into management, there can be bias and barriers that hold them in engineering roles. For instance, some companies suffer from a “grass is always greener on the other side” mentality that promotes outsiders over existing employees. I asked Skrygan if that was an issue he had encountered.

> **– Kirill Skrygan, JetBrains CEO**

That wasn’t an issue at JetBrains, he replied, adding that companies should have to cultivate both promoting internal talent while scouting strong recruits.

“You couldn’t rely only on external ‘grass,’” he said. “You have to raise your own talents. Moreover, it’s not just about highly-paid stars you would hire from the outside. Yes, you need to hire those, but at the same time, you need to invest in hiring juniors [and] interns, raising them, because sometimes juniors are so active, passionate, and this is just very important for the whole spirit of the company, of the team.”

It helps to be in a company that prioritizes cultivating internal talent. JetBrians, for instance, collaborates with universities on internship programs.

“We’re doing a lot to invest our own money to educate young generation people; and yes, we also hire some of these talented people to JetBrains,” he said.

## Cultivating Management Skills as a Developer

I asked Skrygan what skills or benefits programmers bring to management. He replied that good software engineers tend to be very structured and use engineering systems. They understand that you need a solid architecture before developing an application, he said. They have to show logical thinking about both structure and architecture, he added.

“This level, this way of thinking, is very good for managers because when you define business strategy, it’s basically some logic based on presumptions,” he said. “You have some sort of architecture of logic based on some prerequisites. So this structurality, this logical thinking, really helps.”

It’s a cliché to say programmers are introverts — but whether you are or aren’t, programmers who want to move into management should develop and demonstrate people skills if they want to move into management, according to Skrygan. This can take some real work and study, he added.

“Being a manager is not like writing code. You have to be empathetic. You have to work with people. You have to understand their things,” he said.

Developing people skills isn’t a simple step. You don’t just “solve” the people problem and move on.

“You have to be individual with all the people,” he suggested. “You cannot be, like, one size fits all for different kinds of people.”

> Technical managers must have both logical capabilities and the ability to relate to and manage people.  
> **– Skrygan**

Only a small percentage of engineers have that skill, he said, but they need to have both the logical capabilities and the ability to relate to and manage people.

“What I would suggest is to dive deep — more into social, humanitarian aspects and sciences, psychology, group psychology, sociology, or some other things, because this just gives different angles,” he said. “Tech people are very logical thinkers, and they have their own strict angle, and sometimes they do not understand why humans, or humans at scale, behave this way, this strange way. It’s silly, but it’s the way it is, and you have to acknowledge that, and understanding [other] sciences should definitely help.”

He added it helps to be a very agreeable person, which some engineers are not. This can make it difficult to advance in the corporate hierarchy, he said. One thing engineers can do to show they’re agreeable is to realize roles overlap now. That means developers should be ready and willing to help with domains outside their speciality, such as product management or marketing.

But at the same time, you also have to balance that with having strong, deep opinions.

“You have to show it in, of course, in [a] correct way, so… the management understands, hey, he’s not just about this narrow scope; this person is about much broader sense-making, and this person has an opinion about that,” he said. “That’s valuable.”

He also recommended getting an MBA or taking MBA-style courses to understand business.

## Shifting Onto the Management Track

But after acquiring management skills, how can developers convince their company to give them a chance?

That will depend somewhat on the company culture, but he said at a basic level it means getting recognition from management.

“If I can generalize these things, I think that proactiveness and initiative right now would be also interesting,” he said. “Just being an operator in a very transparent way is not quite enough.”

For instance, if you’re given a job, do it with initiative and proactivity. That might look like, for instance, taking charge of tickets to ensure they’re handled if your company just pools them all and expects developers to just do them in their “spare” time.

Developers should also realize that the feedback loop for managers is different from that for developers. It’s much more complicated, he said, but it’s necessary.

> “From my experience, people who are not learning because they’re too stubborn or too stuck up, [that] usually prevents them from being a good managers.”  
> **– Skrygan**

“It works through layers of people, levels of organizations, but you have to be honest with yourself; you have to get the feedback, and you have to improve yourself,” he said. “Being able to frankly get this feedback and get better is important stuff. From my experience, people who are not learning because they’re too stubborn or too stuck up, [that] usually prevents them from being a good managers.”

He also said there’s a difference between management and leadership. Leadership is actually about saying no rather than yes, he noted. That’s because leadership is giving a direction, a focus.

“It’s very easy to say yes to everyone, but if you will say yes to all the ideas you will have, … you will not deliver,” he said. “You need to lead people towards this focus, and you need to engage and inspire people so they actually want to do this.”

Finally — although it may be old-fashioned in today’s work world — Skrygan also believes loyalty is an important trait for those who want to move into management.

“It sounds silly, but it’s sometimes about some of the projects that your managers can delegate to you as a developer, which might not contribute to your salary bonus by the end of the year, but this is what the management asks you to do,” he said. “If you do this, they understand: hey, this is a person we can rely on, who values the interest of the whole company, of the whole organization, even more than their own.”
