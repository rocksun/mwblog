Possibly the most popular programming language in the world, JavaScript underpins the web by enabling dynamic and interactive pages. But its flexibility and versatility are available on a wide range of platforms beyond the browser, from servers and smartphones to embedded systems, and it has emerged as a way of creating rich, engaging applications on all those devices. Annual updates to the language introduce new features and improvements to the functionality, readability and performance of JavaScript. These updates also increase developer productivity, ensuring it’s a language that is fast to write and easy to get started with, keeping it relevant for increasingly challenging scenarios.

## Brief History of JavaScript

The first version of JavaScript, originally called Mocha and then LiveScript, was [written by Brendan Eich](https://thenewstack.io/brendan-eich-on-creating-javascript-in-10-days-and-what-hed-do-differently-today/) as a scripting language for the Netscape browser in just 10 days. But that doesn’t mean the language is poorly designed. Intended to make web pages more dynamic and interactive, it drew on concepts and features from existing languages like Scheme and Java and has been extensively developed since. Although the language became an ECMAScript standard (officially ECMA-262 by ECMA International) in 1997, updates stalled for a while after the release of ECMAScript 5 (ES5) in 2009, yet it had an unusually rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks to help JavaScript keep up with the rapid evolution of web technologies. Since 2015, when major revisions came out with ES6, there have been annual updates to harness the creativity of the JavaScript community and bring new features in the language in a standardized way.

Over the years, developers realized that JavaScript could be useful beyond the browser as a general-purpose language on a range of platforms and environments. The introduction of Node.js in 2009, as an open source cross-platform runtime using the V8 engine, brought JavaScript to server-side programming. This expansion made JavaScript not just a tool for creating interactive web interfaces, but a way to handle complex backend tasks in the same fast, efficient language.

## Current Relevance

Widely used and regularly updated, JavaScript remains a cornerstone of modern web development, which includes mobile devices and environments far beyond the browser. Its ubiquity is unparalleled: it delivers interactive elements in web pages, powers frontend frameworks like React, Angular and Vue.js, and is also used to build desktop applications (via Electron), backend services (via Node.js and Deno), and serverless functions (e.g. Cloudflare Workers, which uses lightweight V8 isolates). JavaScript’s flexibility and adaptability have allowed it to remain at the forefront of web development trends, allowing developers to deliver ever-more-sophisticated web applications.

Strong community support and a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks — along with supporting technologies like [TypeScript](https://thenewstack.io/typescript/) and complementary platforms like [WebAssembly](https://thenewstack.io/webassembly/) — help JavaScript stay relevant and versatile across a wide range of development scenarios.

If you’re just getting started with JavaScript, here’s a look at the fundamentals of the language, from variables and data types to control structures and functions. Let’s also explore advanced concepts that give JavaScript its power and versatility — including key frameworks and libraries — with some tips on best practices to ensure your JavaScript code is not only functional, but also efficient, maintainable and secure.

Perhaps more than any other language, JavaScript is driven by the community, so connecting with other developers will help you stay on top of the latest developments.

## Fundamentals of JavaScript

New JavaScript developers should start by understanding basic syntax and data types.

### Basic Concepts: Variables, Data Types, Operators

* **Variables**: In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. JavaScript uses the keywords `var`, `let` and `const` to declare and assign variables. While `var` is function-scoped and still valid, `let` and `const` are block-scoped and preferred in modern JavaScript. `const` is used for values that shouldn’t be reassigned.
* **Data types**: JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means the type of a variable is determined when the code runs rather than when it’s compiled. The primary data types are:
  + **Primitive types**: String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Undefined, Null and Symbol.
  + **Non-primitive types**: The reference or derived data types are used to store collections of data: Object, Array, Function, Map, Set, WeakMap and WeakSet. Objects are key-value pairs, and arrays are ordered collections of values. Arrays and Functions are technically specialized objects in JavaScript; Maps and Sets were introduced in ES6 as alternatives to plain objects for key-value and unique-value storage, respectively.
* **Operators**: JavaScript includes various operators used with expressions and statements to perform calculations and logic. These include:
  + **Arithmetic operators**: Perform basic mathematical operations with operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `%` and `/`.
  + **Comparison operators**: Compare two values with `==`, `===`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and so on.
  + **Logical operators**: The three primary logical operators are `&& (and)`, `|| (or)` and `! (not)`. They return true or false by evaluating the variables and values in the expression.
  + **String, bitwise, conditional and type operators**.
* **Use regular expressions**, text formatting and the emerging internationalization options to process strings and display text.

### Control Flow and Error Handling

Loops: JavaScript supports several types of loops to repeat actions:

* **For loop**: Iterates a set number of times or loops through the properties (For/In) or values (For/Of) an object.
* **While loop**: Continues as long as the specified condition is true.
* **Do/while loop**: Executes the code block once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true.

Use break and continue statements to control the flow of code in loops.

* **Conditionals**: These statements allow decision-making in code by executing different code blocks. The `if/else` statement executes a block of code if the specified condition is true, and another block if it is false; use `else if` to add a further statement to test. The switch statement is used for selecting one of many code blocks to be executed.
* **Error handling**: Handle errors and exceptions with `try...catch` statements. The try block contains code that may throw an error; the code to handle that error is in the catch block. Use a final block for code that will execute whether or not an error occurs.

### JavaScript Functions and Scope

* **Functions**: Sections of reusable code that perform a specific task. They are the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript code, declared using the function keyword.
* **Expressions**: Any valid unit of code that resolves to a value — including variables, literals, operators and functions calls — is a JavaScript expression. If you assign a function to a variable, creating a function expression, you can leave out the function name.
* **Arrow functions**: Introduced in ES6, arrow functions allow you to write functions much more concisely. You don’t need the function keyword, and if the functions consist of a single expression, you don’t need the return keyword. They are particularly useful for short functions but can’t be used as methods or constructors.
* **Closures**: A closure in JavaScript is a specific function that has access to a wider scope of variables: its own scope, the scope of the outer function and the global scope. Closures are powerful. You can use them to create modular, reusable code, to preserve state when you use asynchronous operations or to emulate private methods and variables, but they can also cause memory leaks and other unexpected behavior.

### JavaScript in the Browser: DOM Manipulation, Events

Although the [JavaScript language](https://thenewstack.io/javascript/ "JavaScript language") no longer only runs inside browsers, because it started as a web scripting language it has specific options for working with web pages:

* **DOM manipulation**: The Document Object Model (DOM) is the interface that allows JavaScript to change the content and structure of a web page to make it dynamic and interactive: creating, removing or modifying HTML elements and attributes, and enabling dynamic updates to the page structure and content.
* **Events**: JavaScript can react to what the user does on a web page — clicking on buttons, moving the cursor, pressing keys and entering text — to display navigation menus, pop-ups and other ways of interacting with the page. JavaScript lets developers track events like clicks, mouse movements, key presses or form submissions with event listeners (addEventListener) and define JavaScript functions (event handlers) to be executed when events occur.

## Advanced JavaScript Concepts

Although you can make web pages interactive with fairly simple JavaScript, for complex applications, you will want to turn to more sophisticated and powerful programming techniques.

### Functional and Object-Oriented Programming

* **JavaScript supports both functional and object-oriented programming (OOP)**. Functional programming treats data as immutable and functions as first-class objects that can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned by functions and assigned to variables. While JavaScript does not enforce immutability, functional patterns — such as avoiding side effects and treating functions as first-class values — are widely used and encouraged. OOP in JavaScript uses the prototype mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features, so it works a little differently from classical object-oriented programming languages.
* **Classes and objects**: Built on top of prototypes, JavaScript classes are syntactic sugar over constructor functions and prototypes, providing a clearer syntax for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class with properties and methods, so a `Car` class might have properties like brand and color or methods like `start()`. Use classes to encapsulate data with the code that will operate over that data.
* **Inheritance and polymorphism**: Creating new classes based on existing ones allows the child class to reuse the methods and variables of the parent class. Using the `extends` keyword, a class can be declared as a child of another class. And you can use polymorphism to override any methods in the parent class that aren’t useful in the child class to perform different operations. This is useful for creating a hierarchical structure in code, reducing redundancy and enhancing reusability. For instance, an electric car class could extend a car class, inheriting its properties and adding new features like battery capacity, but overriding the warning that the gas cap hasn’t been replaced after filling up, with code to check whether the car is still plugged in.
* **Modules and namespaces**: There are other ways to organize and encapsulate code in JavaScript. Modules allow you to break your code up into separate files (useful for large codebases), or you can organize the functions of your code into local groups with namespace objects. If you want a more formal structured option for handling namespaces, TypeScript adds a namespace keyword. While TypeScript includes a namespace keyword, modern code typically prefers ES6 module syntax (import/export) for structure and encapsulation.

### Asynchronous Programming: Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await

Because JavaScript is single-threaded but also frequently runs in the browser, it needs a way to run code without blocking the main thread and slow the rendering of the web page you’re looking at. Long-running tasks are delegated to the browser’s background processes and when they finish, a callback function is triggered to handle the results. Tasks like network requests or timers are handled by browser APIs (outside the JS engine), and once completed, their callbacks are placed on the message queue to be picked up by the event loop.

* **Callbacks**: A callback is a function passed into another function as an argument and executed at a later time. Callbacks enable asynchronous programming in JavaScript but are difficult to write and debug.
* **Promises**: Introduced in ES2015 to handle the complexities of callbacks, a promise is an object representing the eventual outcome — completion or failure — of an asynchronous operation. [Promises](https://thenewstack.io/what-are-promises-in-javascript/) abstract over asynchronous behavior and provide a cleaner, chainable alternative to callbacks using `.then()` and `.catch()`.
* **Generators**: While generators don’t directly await Promises, they can be used to write asynchronous code by yielding Promises — typically managed via helper libraries or async flow control.
* **Async/await**: The async/await syntax was added in ES2017 to make it easier to work with promises and generators and write asynchronous code that looks more like synchronous code. Put the `async` keyword before a function to mark it as asynchronous and use the `await` keyword inside the function to pause the execution of the function code until the promise is resolved, and then resume the code.

## JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries

While you can create interactive web pages and apps from scratch in JavaScript, frameworks and libraries make life easier, giving you built-in functions for common tasks (which improves the consistency and reliability of your code), supplementing missing features in the language, improving cross-platform compatibility so that apps work across a wider range of devices, optimizing performance, and giving you access to support from an active community of developers. It may take a little more work to learn them, but frameworks and libraries provide structures, patterns and extra tools.

### Popular JavaScript Frameworks: Angular, Ember.js, Vue.js, Babylon.js

* **Angular**: Maintained by Google, Angular is a widely used framework for building single-page apps (SPAs). It has a component-based architecture for modularity, uses templates to make creating UI views simple, and has rich features like two-way data binding, modularization, AJAX handling and dependency injection. Angular has a steep learning curve, but there are a lot of courses and tutorials and it’s well-suited for building large-scale, high-performance applications. Don’t confuse it with the older Angular.js, which is no longer developed or supported by Google.
* **Ember.js**: Another component-based framework for creating SPAs, Ember uses templates, provides default behaviors that make it quick to get started, is strongly opinionated (to the point that all apps have the same structure) and has its own built-in router, state management and development environment, with an Inspector and Ember CLI that some other libraries like Glimmer.js have adopted.
* **Vue.js**: A simpler progressive framework for building user interfaces, SPAs and smaller projects, Vue.js is designed to be easy to get started with and to add to existing projects. The core library focuses on the view layer only and handles data binding, CSS transitions and animations, but you can add a router, scheduling and CLI for project scaffolding and bring in more libraries if you want to build more powerful SPAs.
* **Babylon.js**: A powerful 3D engine based on WebGL and JavaScript, you can use Babylon.js as a library for displaying 3D models and scenes, or as a framework with built-in components that can help you build complex interactive 3D applications.

### JavaScript Library Ecosystem: React, jQuery, Lodash, Moment.js, D3.js

* **React**: Developed by Facebook (now Meta), React is a declarative, efficient and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces and reusable components for dynamic applications. React is so powerful, it’s usually treated as a framework. Its virtual DOM, which optimizes updates to the actual DOM for enhanced performance, allows developers to create large web applications that can change data without reloading the page. You will need to learn its JSX markup syntax, and it doesn’t handle any server-side logic, but there is a strong community with many resources for learning.
* **jQuery**: An enduringly popular JavaScript library, but with the improvements in the language since ES2015, many of the tasks [jQuery](https://thenewstack.io/why-outdated-jquery-is-still-the-dominant-javascript-library/) handles can now be done directly in JavaScript. You may still need it for legacy projects that rely on it for simplifying HTML document manipulations, event handling, animation and Ajax interactions, but it’s not likely to be your first choice for new projects.
* **Lodash**: A utility library that makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, and so on, Lodash has modular methods that are great for iterating arrays, objects and strings; manipulating and testing values; and creating composite functions.
* **Moment.js**: Moment.js was the de facto date library for years, but the new Temporal API (Stage 4, available in Node.js 20+ and modern browsers) is now a standard replacement.
* **D3.js**: Data-Driven Documents (D3.js) is a library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations using SVG, HTML and CSS rather than a proprietary framework.

### Choosing the Right JavaScript Framework/Library: Factors to Consider

When there are multiple options, choose between them the way you would pick any other development tool:

* **Project requirements**: Assess the specific needs of your project. For complex, enterprise-level applications, a comprehensive framework like Angular might be suitable. For dynamic interfaces with reusable components, React is a great choice. For smaller projects or particular functionalities like data visualization, a library like D3.js might be all you need.
* **Learning curve**: Consider the time and effort required to learn the framework or library. React has a steeper learning curve than Vue.js, but offers more flexibility in large applications.
* **Community and ecosystem**: A strong community and ecosystem mean better support, more resources — including documentation and tutorials to help you learn — and a higher likelihood of the framework or library being maintained and updated regularly. Make sure any security issues with a library or framework are being addressed quickly.
* **Performance**: Evaluate the performance implications of the framework or library for your specific use case, because while they might provide caching, compressions, lazy loading or minifications that speed up your app, the size and overhead of the framework itself might end up making your overall app larger or smaller. Consider aspects like load time, runtime efficiency and memory consumption.
* **Compatibility and flexibility**: Look at the other tools and technologies used in your project and make sure the library or framework you’re considering works well with them. Plan ahead: If you expect to add new features and technologies, it may be worth adopting a framework that will support those from the start rather than rewriting to use it as your app grows.

With modern JavaScript, it’s perfectly possible to write powerful apps without frameworks and libraries, but picking the right ones can improve the performance, efficiency, maintainability and scalability of your applications. Pick the one that best fits the requirements, complexity and long-term goals of your project, along with the team’s expertise and preferences.

## JavaScript in Modern Web Development

JavaScript has come a long way from merely scripting interactions in web pages. Modern web development allows developers to create dynamic, interactive web apps with rich user interfaces and all the features you’d expect in a desktop app, whether that’s an SPA built with a framework like Angular, server-side applications that run the same JavaScript code as the frontend interface, or cross-platform desktop and mobile applications built with web technologies but taking advantage of native features on the device.

### Single-Page Applications: Powered by JavaScript

SPAs make it easier to build complex websites that feel like an application by having the browser load a single HTML page and dynamically update content as the user interacts with the app. Unlike a traditional site, where each page is separate with its own HTML, CSS and JavaScript and has to be maintained separately, an SPA contains the code for the entire site (although modern SPAs typically use code-splitting to load only the necessary parts of the app initially). Frameworks like Angular, Ember.js, [React.js](https://thenewstack.io/javascripts-history-and-how-it-led-to-reactjs/) and [Vue.js](https://thenewstack.io/meet-vue-js-flexible-javascript-framework/) offer structured ways to create responsive and interactive user interfaces using JavaScript, whether you’re creating a mobile app or a dynamic web page.

This approach avoids page reloads, offering a faster, smoother user experience, reducing load time, making the app feel more responsive, and reducing the bandwidth and impact on battery life for mobile devices by only downloading the new data and not the entire page each time. Using JavaScript, SPAs enable more engaging interfaces with animations, transitions, drag-and-drop interactivity, push notifications, offline mode and other features that make a web app feel more like a native app — although you may need to use service workers and other advanced JavaScript features to support these options.

Despite the name, you can build powerful and complex sites — like Netflix, Gmail or Facebook — as SPAs. If you want more advanced features like authentication and push notifications, you will need backend code too. SPAs can also use the same JavaScript code for the frontend and backend, simplifying development and making them easier to debug and maintain.

### Beyond SPAs: Progressive Web Apps, Web Components and VR

**Progressive Web Apps:** Many of the more interesting features you can build in SPAs rely on service workers and web APIs. Progressive web apps (PWAs) take this a step further. They offer the same benefits as SPAs by caching data and resources locally for faster response and offline usage; using service workers to handle network requests, including push notifications; and mimicking the look and feel of native apps, with the option (OS-dependent) to install them on a device’s home screen and access them from the app launcher. In addition, code splitting allows a PWA to load only the code for the current view, which can give a faster initial load than a SPA.

PWAs operate in a sandboxed environment enforced by the browser, and service workers run in isolated threads. Combined with HTTPS requirements, this helps prevent common attacks like XSS and CORS misuse. You can update them remotely to address security issues. They are also more discoverable for SEO.

The downside is that PWAs can be more complex and expensive to build than a SPA that runs only on the client, but some SPAs require backend components as well.

**Web components**: Introduced over a decade ago, web components weren’t supported across all major browsers until 2018, so adoption has been slow. But using these web platform APIs in JavaScript to create custom HTML elements with their own content, style and functionality allows developers to create encapsulated, reusable, accessible components that don’t require specific frameworks or libraries (but they also work with any framework or library you already use).

**VR**: WebVR was a JavaScript API giving developers access to the features and sensors of virtual reality devices, allowing them to render stereoscopic views in their web apps. It’s since been deprecated, replaced by the by the WebXR Device API, but understanding its basics can be helpful for learning about web-based VR development.

### Server-Side JavaScript: From Node.js to Serverless

* **Node.js**: Bringing JavaScript to servers with Node.js revolutionized the capabilities of the language. A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. It’s no longer the only server-side runtime: Deno and Bun are also popular.
* **Express.js**: This framework  provides a routing system, middleware support, template engine and error handling to simplify the process of creating web servers and APIs using Node.js. Scalable and lightweight, it simplifies the task of writing server-side logic and handling HTTP requests.
* **Serverless**: JavaScript runtimes can run in different environments including edge computing and on serverless platforms like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) Lambda, [Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) Azure Functions, Cloudflare Workers, [Google](https://cloud.google.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) Cloud Functions and Vercel Functions, enabling developers to run snippets of code in response to events without needing to manage server infrastructure.

### Fetching Data, RESTful Services, Going Pre-Built with Jamstack

JavaScript plays a vital role in interacting with APIs to fetch data. The fetch API in JavaScript allows web browsers to make HTTP requests to web servers, obtaining or sending data essential for web applications. This is crucial for functionalities like loading new content, submitting forms or interacting with third-party services.

It’s unlikely that all the APIs you want to use will be built into the browser. JavaScript can use APIs to access and manipulate data from a wide range of websites and third-party services, letting you create dynamic, interactive sites and web apps. JavaScript can send requests to REST APIs, which use HTTP methods and return responses in JSON or XML. Most modern REST APIs use JSON for request and response bodies due to its native compatibility with JavaScript. You could use REST APIs to interact with a backend database, add geolocation to a web app, or play music on a website.

The asynchronous options in JavaScript, especially with promises and async/await, simplify handling responses from APIs. This allows applications to remain responsive and performant, even while making several background data requests.

The Jamstack (JavaScript, API and markup) architectural approach can be useful if you don’t need complex interactions or real-time updates and can use static, pre-built HTML files from a CDN rather than building them on the server as needed. It lets you build sites that move all the logic client-side, with the backend consisting of APIs and serverless functions, with all the interactions generated in the page, and authentication and authorization handled by third-party APIs. It can help you improve security and performance, as well as reduce costs.

## Best Practices in JavaScript

Make your life easier by following these JavaScript implementation principles for creating robust, maintainable and secure code.

### Code Quality: Writing Clean, Readable Code

* **Clear and concise**: Strive for simplicity in your JavaScript code. Avoid unnecessary complexity, aim for clarity and don’t make your code so abbreviated you forget how it works. This makes the code more readable and easier for others (or yourself in the future) to understand and maintain.
* **Consistent coding style**: Adopt a consistent coding style, including naming conventions, indentation and commenting. Tools like ESLint can help enforce coding standards, ensuring a unified codebase — especially in team environments.
* **Use descriptive variable and function names**: Choose names that clearly indicate the purpose and usage of variables and functions. Descriptive names make your code self-documenting and reduce the need for excessive comments.
* **Code comments and documentation**: Code isn’t finished until it’s documented. Explaining decisions that seem obvious at the time will help anyone else who works on the code later — including you, when you have to pick up a project months or years later.
* **Code refactoring**: As well as fixing specific bugs, refactor your code to improve its structure and readability. Restructuring the way the code is written without changing what it does helps you improve older code as your skills develop. There are developer tools to help you do it.

### Performance Optimization: Tips for Efficient JavaScript Coding

* **Efficient DOM manipulation**: Minimize direct interactions with the Document Object Model (DOM), as these can be performance-intensive. Use document fragments or update the DOM off-screen before re-rendering.
* **Optimize loops**: Be cautious with loops, especially within other loops, as these can significantly hurt performance. Use built-in methods like `forEach`, `map`, `filter`or `reduce` where appropriate.
* **Asynchronous loading**: Use asynchronous JavaScript to load scripts without blocking the rendering of the page. This improves loading time and overall performance of the application.
* **Memory management**: Unnecessary variables or data structures can lead to increased memory consumption. Use garbage collection effectively by dereferencing unused objects, but leave JavaScript to handle the garbage collection for you.

### Security Considerations: Common Vulnerabilities, Safe Coding Practices

* **Avoid global variables**: Minimize the use of global variables to reduce the risk of code conflicts and potential security issues.
* **Validate user inputs**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs to protect against common vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection, but don’t frustrate users by rejecting input that you can reformat automatically, like the structure of a phone number.
* **Update APIs and libraries**: Ensure that you are using secure and updated versions of APIs and libraries. Regularly check for updates or patches that fix vulnerabilities.
* **Implement error handling**: Robust error handling can prevent your code from exposing sensitive information and system details. It will make your site or application less frustrating for users.

## Learning and Community Resources in JavaScript
