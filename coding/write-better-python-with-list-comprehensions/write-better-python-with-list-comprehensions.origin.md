[Python](https://thenewstack.io/python/) list comprehensions generate new lists from existing lists and sequences in one efficient, readable line of code. They provide a concise syntax for completing this task, limiting our lines of code. Rather than using multiple lines of code to perform operations using loops, [list comprehensions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_comprehension.asp) embed the loop and optional condition in a single line using a pair of square brackets. List comprehensions can use any iterable (sets, strings, tuples, lists) to generate a new list. List comprehensions can be used with a single list or to flatten nested lists.
List comprehensions are considered “[Pythonic](https://thenewstack.io/mit-created-compiler-speeds-up-python-code/)” style code in that they closely align with Python’s philosophy of writing simple, efficient code. Not only are they effective with the operation they’re carrying out, but list comprehensions are also easier to read and understand at first glance.

Here’s an example of a loop that builds a list of even numbers:

output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

Versus those same operations performed as a list comprehension:

output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

List comprehensions are a helpful tool when it comes to many of the repetitive tasks and data processing previously done by loops. Some examples of list comprehensions in the real world are:

Fast web content rendering: List comprehensions automate the creation of repetitive HTML tags or strings. This dynamic contentment generation eases the development process for creating text-based content (ex. links, table rows).

[Data analytics](https://thenewstack.io/whats-pipeline-free-real-time-data-analytics/): List comprehensions reduce code complexity this eliminating any potential bugs and errors. They streamline data transformation and allow for quick and readable data modifications. Processing tasks such as converting values to other values specifically are a great use case for list comprehensions.
Quicker prototyping and testing cycles: Developers can simulate real-world scenarios by creating mock data, such as user profiles and transactions, using list comprehensions.

Easier system troubleshooting and monitoring: List comprehensions provide an elegant framework for filtering and analyzing log files quickly. Developers can write a simple line of code that quickly scan through logs and extracts relevant entries, like system trends and application logs.

Enable efficient calculation across large datasets: List comprehensions reduce the need for lengthy, repetitive looping when performing mathematical and data-intensive tasks like normalizing values or applying statistical calculations. List comprehensions aren’t a catch-all solution. While they are powerful for specific tasks, they aren’t usable in all cases. Traditional loops provide greater control, readability and flexibility when handling extensive logic, in-place modifications, error handling, memory-intensive operations and error handling. List comprehensions are best suited for simple, single-step transformations and filtering where a new list is the intended output.

## The How-To’s:
Here’s the list basic syntax for working with a single list:

The `if`
condition is not required. Only use the `if`
condition if your code uses a condition.

Here’s a simple list comprehension example without an `if`
conditional:

Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

Here’s the same example with an `if`
condition added.

Output: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100, 144, 196, 256, 324, 400]

The basic syntax for list comprehensions that simplify nested loops looks like this:

Here’s an example without the conditional statement:

Output: [(‘red’, ‘circle’), (‘red’, ‘square’), (‘green’, ‘circle’), (‘green’, ‘square’), (‘blue’, ‘circle’), (‘blue’, ‘square’)]

The final example includes a conditional statement:

Output: Prints: [(‘red’, ‘circle’), (‘red’, ‘square’)]

List comprehensions are a valuable tool in [Python programming](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-python/), enhancing efficiency and readability while simplifying many common tasks. By understanding their strengths and limitations, developers can leverage this feature to write cleaner and more “Pythonic” code.
