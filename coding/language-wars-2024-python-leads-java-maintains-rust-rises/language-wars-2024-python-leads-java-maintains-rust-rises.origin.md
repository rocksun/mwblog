2024 was a very good year for programming languages. Python usage rose for AI/machine learning apps, Java continued its dominance in enterprise app development and Rust emerged as a go-to language for memory-safe development.

Here are some of 2024’s highlights.

## Python Flying High
Among programming languages, [Python](https://thenewstack.io/python/) is flying high right now. It will likely be the language of the year for 2024 in the [TIOBE Index of programming languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). This feat is accomplished by the language that gains the highest increase in ratings in a given year. Python had a ratings gain of 10% in one year. The two closest behind it were Java and JavaScript, which increased 1.73% and 1.72%, respectively.

[Paul Jansen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-jansen-299429/), founder and CEO of TIOBE Software, noted that those languages had a “positive” increase. “But it seems marginal if compared to the gigantic leap of Python in 2024,” he said. “Python is unstoppable thanks to its support for AI and data mining, its large set of libraries and its ease of learning.”
### Dominance in AI and Generative Technologies
Python remained the leading language for AI and machine learning development, particularly with the rapid growth of generative AI technologies, [Arnal Dayaratna](https://x.com/cloud4computing), an analyst at IDC, told The New Stack.

“Frameworks such as [TensorFlow](https://thenewstack.io/python-tutorial-use-tensorflow-to-generate-predictive-text/) and [PyTorch](https://thenewstack.io/why-pytorch-gets-all-the-love/), along with libraries like [Hugging Face’s](https://huggingface.co/) Transformers, continued to dominate the generative AI developer ecosystem, enabling developers to expediently build and deploy advanced solutions in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and generative model training,” Dayaratna said. “Python’s simplicity and integration with diverse data science tools allowed for rapid prototyping and deployment, ensuring its position as the preferred language for organizations building next-generation AI applications.”

### A Stable Ecosystem
Meanwhile, [Peter Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pzwang/), co-founder and chief AI and innovation officer at [Anaconda](https://thenewstack.io/faster-python-easier-access-to-llms-anacondas-ai-roadmap/), which offers enterprise-grade package curation as an alternative to [PyPI](https://thenewstack.io/whos-keeping-the-python-ecosystem-safe/), said he witnessed the Python ecosystem stabilizing in 2024.

“Python continues to be a really powerful and wonderful language for doing data analysis … It’s clearly the language of AI, and we’re really excited to see what next year brings for us,” Wang said.

[Michael Kennedy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkennedy/), the founder of Talk Python and a [Python Software Foundation (PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/) Fellow, wrote a broadly informative post, published Dec. 10 on [JetBrains’](https://thenewstack.io/ai-and-ides-walking-through-how-jetbrains-is-approaching-ai/) PyCharm blog, about the [state of Python in 2024](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2024/12/the-state-of-python/).
“A couple of years ago, Python became the most popular language on Stack Overflow,” Kennedy wrote. “Then, Python jumped to the number one language on the [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). Presently, Python is twice as popular as the second most popular language on the index (C++)! Most significantly, in November 2024, [Github announced](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/?featured_on=pythonbytes) that Python is now the most used language on GitHub.”

### Recent Moves
Among the most recent Python community moves, Wang said he finds the merged multithreaded Python support — removal of the [global interpreter lock (GIL)](https://thenewstack.io/pythons-gil-multithreading-and-multiprocessing/) — as key. Although the removal is not enabled by default. Also, he said, the addition of [WebAssembly backend support](https://thenewstack.io/reversing-web-assembly-project-extends-web-components/) for the core Python interpreter, is important.

Moreover, “the Python packaging ecosystem continues to be interesting,” Wang told The New Stack. “It can be a whole basket of angry cats or whatever you want to call it.”

Yet, he noted that in the Python package world, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) — a fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust — “has really been gaining a lot of mind share and traction.

But there are other projects, like [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) and [Hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) that continue to advance and have their adherents as well.”

Also, this year in particular, large companies such as [Nvidia](https://thenewstack.io/nvidia-wants-to-rewrite-the-software-development-stack/) have leaned in to try to figure out how to make the Python packaging story better — partially because they have such huge packages to support AI and ML use cases. “When you put the GPU support code in these packages they get really, really big,” Wang said.

### Popularity Comes at a Price
Python has begun to see more malicious actors trying to attack apps built in the language.

“We are seeing continuing growth of an increase in supply chain attacks,” Wang said. “Now that Python is the No. 1 language … Popularity has its drawbacks and so many more people are starting to attack.”

Tension is emerging, Wang said, between Python’s volunteer-run infrastructure and its growing role as critical global infrastructure, particularly around security and package management. However, he added, two-factor authentication is an option for securing control over your packages.

### Rapid Adoption
“A whopping 41% of Python developers have been using Python for less than two years,” Kennedy wrote in his blog post.

GitHub’s insight into Python’s growth shows that “[Python’s] continued growth over the past few years — alongside that of Jupyter Notebooks — may suggest that [Python developers’] activity on GitHub is going beyond traditional software development,” he wrote.

And regarding Python frameworks, he wrote, “63% of web developers use [Django](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-pythons-django/) compared to 42% using [Flask](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-use-flask-a-lightweight-python-framework/). On the other hand, data scientists prefer Flask and FastAPI each over Django.”

## Java: the King Stays the King
After nearly 30 years, [Java](https://thenewstack.io/java/) continues to be the lifeblood of many enterprise systems, and the workhorse programming language shows no signs of slowing down.

Java will turn 30 in May of 2025 and still ranks among the top three most popular languages in many reports including the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).

### How Java Stays Relevant
“Strong typing, good abstractions, core libraries, memory safety performance, observability and security along with extensive third-party library, tool and SDK support continue to make Java a strong choice for enterprises, and 2024 saw no end of Java’s growth for those reasons,” [Georges Saab](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgessaab/), senior vice president of the [Oracle](https://developer.oracle.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) Java Platform and chair of the [OpenJDK](https://thenewstack.io/the-hidden-risks-of-unsupported-openjdk-in-financial-systems/) governing board, told The New Stack.

Moreover, two more on-time predictable releases of the Java platform were delivered in 2024, with [JDK 22](https://thenewstack.io/java-22-making-java-more-attractive-for-ai-apps-workloads/) and [JDK 23](https://thenewstack.io/oracle-unveils-java-23-simplicity-meets-enterprise-power/). These releases continued improving performance and productivity for enterprise developers, as well as providing features that benefit those using Java with AI integration.

“A great example is the release of the [Foreign Function Memory API in JDK 22](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/22/core/foreign-function-and-memory-api.html), which made it easier, faster and safer to interact with foreign functions, and the later launch of [Project Babylon](https://openjdk.org/projects/babylon/), which looks to extend the reach of Java into foreign programming models such as on those running on GPUs,” Saab said.

### Java for AI and Machine Learning
Java continues to prove its resilience and relevance as a leading programming language by consistently evolving to meet the demands of modern software development, [Simon Ritter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siritter/), deputy CTO at Java platform provider [Azul](https://www.azul.com/?utm_content=inline+mention), told The New Stack.

“In 2024, Java introduced significant advancements that further cemented its position in critical areas like AI, machine learning and cloud computing,” Ritter said. “Features such as virtual threads and structured concurrency in [Java 21](https://thenewstack.io/we-can-have-nice-things-upgrading-to-java-21-is-worth-it/) have revolutionized performance and scalability, enabling developers to build high-performance, concurrent applications more efficiently. Enhanced tooling, like improved [Visual Studio Code](https://thenewstack.io/building-with-flutter-using-visual-studio-code-a-dev-guide/) integration, has streamlined workflows, boosting developer productivity and paving the way for more sophisticated AI implementations.”

Meanwhile, Java’s robust ecosystem also saw key developments that make it a standout platform for AI and machine learning.

“Libraries such as the [Deep Java Library (DJL)](https://djl.ai/) and [langchain4J](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/) offer powerful tools for building AI solutions, while seamless integration with cloud native platforms like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) Cloud supports distributed AI applications at scale,” Ritter said.

Additionally, advancements like quantum-safe encryption address future security challenges, and ensure that Java remains a reliable choice for safeguarding sensitive AI data.

“With these innovations,” Ritter said, “Java continues to lead in enterprise applications, digital transformation and cutting-edge [AI/ML](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-1-31-arrives-with-new-support-for-ai-ml-networking/) solutions, proving its adaptability and strength as a platform for the next generation of technology.”

### Java for Enterprise and Mission-Critical Systems
Speaking about Java’s continued modernization and enterprise focus, IDC’s Dayaratna said Java reinforced its position as a cornerstone for enterprise and mission-critical applications with the release of JDK 23 in September.

“This latest feature release introduced several enhancements, including refinements to virtual threads, improvements in [garbage collection](https://thenewstack.io/does-garbage-collection-logging-affect-app-performance/), and expanded pattern matching capabilities,” Dayaratna told The New Stack. “Virtual threads, first introduced in earlier iterations through [Project Loom](https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/), have become instrumental in simplifying high-concurrency application development, significantly improving developer productivity.

“These advancements make Java more relevant for modern cloud native architectures while maintaining the backward compatibility and reliability critical for legacy systems. Java’s consistent evolution through innovations like JDK 23 underscores its enduring importance in delivering scalable and secure solutions for enterprises.”

[The Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/), which supports enterprise Java developers with projects like [Jakarta EE](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jakartaee-platform), and also leads the Temurin and Adoptium projects, has seen significant progress this year, said [Mike Milinkovich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemilinkovich/), executive director of the foundation.
“At the Eclipse Foundation, in 2024 we celebrated a major milestone when we hit 500 million total downloads of the [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/) OpenJDK distribution. Since its inception three years ago, [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) has had a major impact on the Java ecosystem by delivering free, fully compatible, community-supported, enterprise-grade Java runtimes.”

Eclipse Temurin is an open source Java SE build based upon OpenJDK. Jakarta EE is a set of specifications, extending [Java SE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_SE) with specifications for enterprise features such as distributed computing and web services. Jakarta EE applications are run on reference runtimes, which can be microservices or application servers, which handle transactions, security, scalability, concurrency and management of the components they are deploying.

### Java Community and Ecosystem Evolution
Meanwhile, regarding developments across the Java community and industry, throughout 2024 we saw many different organizations work together with Oracle, the stewards of Java, in the OpenJDK community to continue driving Java development on a global scale.

“For example, 25 new [Java User Groups (JUGs)](https://dev.java/community/jugs/) were added this year, for a total of 347 recognized JUGs across the globe,” Saab said. “This broad industry support has helped increase Java’s development speed, grow the developer base, and contribute to the predictability of releases as Java approaches its 30th anniversary in May 2025.”

## Need Memory Safety?: Count On Rust
Meanwhile, [Rust](https://thenewstack.io/rust-programming-language/) has emerged as a systems programming leader. Rust ranks at number 14 on the TIOBE Index.

Rust continued to gain prominence in 2024, becoming the go-to language for performance-critical and safety-focused applications, IDC’s Dayaratna told The New Stack.

“Its ownership model and borrow checker guarantee memory safety without the need for garbage collection, making it ideal for building reliable software in domains such as embedded systems, cloud native infrastructure, and automotive applications,” he said.

Moreover, “Rust’s ability to prevent common programming errors like data races and memory leaks has made it a favorite in industries requiring high reliability,” Dayaratna noted. “Additionally, its modern tooling ecosystem, including the [Cargo package manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), has streamlined development workflows, further increasing adoption across a wide range of use cases.”

According to a recent [JetBrains developer survey](https://thenewstack.io/developers-testing-more-jetbrains-study-finds/), Rust continues to incrementally gain users. In 2024, 11% of respondents reported using Rust in the last 12 months, up from 10% in 2023 and 9% in 2022. Yet, C++ adoption has not declined. This may partially be due to the fact that the migration from C++ to Rust isn’t happening all at once, according to [Lawrence E. Hecht](https://thenewstack.io/author/lawrence-hecht/), The New Stack’s research director.

Moreover, among C++ users, 21% already use Rust to some degree and another 14% plan to adopt it. And 11% of Rust developers use C++ alongside Rust in the same projects, but only 5% developers who primarily use C++ actually use Rust alongside C++ in the same projects.

Among the primary C++ developers who do use Rust in the same project, 58% plan to migrate additional pieces of code to Rust in the next 12 months. However, fewer developers are using another language in projects where Rust is used. In 2024, 41% of Rust developers use no other language in their Rust projects, down from 49% in 2023. 41%.

### Will Rust replace C++?
“The only language to set a new usage record among this year’s most popular ones is Rust,” [the JetBrains study](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2024/) said. “Aspiring to replace C++ with its strict safety and memory ownership mechanisms, Rust has seen its user base steadily grow over the last five years. According to our data, one in six [Go](https://thenewstack.io/go/) users is considering adopting Rust.

The study found that Rust and Go are the most adopted languages. “The languages most respondents plan to adopt are clearly Go and Rust,” the study said. “Both languages are built with performance and concurrency in mind and have compiler safety guarantees in place to help reduce bugs. However, while we see Rust’s popularity growing, the share of Go developers remains stable.”

### Change in Attitude
“For me the big change has been a change in attitude,” [Tim McNamara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timmcnamaranz/), founder of the [Accelerant.dev](https://accelerant.dev/) tech consultancy from Wellington, New Zealand, and author of “[Rust in Action](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Action-TS-McNamara/dp/1617294551),” told The New Stack.

“It’s nice seeing that many parts of the Rust community have a sense of accomplishment and success. Rust had a few bumpy years of what I might call growing pains. It seems that the community is in an extremely healthy place, thanks to the invisible work of many people and small interactions incrementally working to create a healthier ecosystem.” (For more of McNamara’s views about the state of the language, check out “[Big Moments in Rust 2024](https://thenewstack.io/big-moments-in-rust-2024/).”)

### Rust Foundation Stewardship
“2024 has been a landmark year for Rust, reaffirming its place as a [top programming language](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) for safety, security, and performance, while maintaining its status as [the most-admired language](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology/#admired-and-desired), [Rebecca Rumbul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-rumbul-96a5441a), executive director and CEO of the [Rust Foundation](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/), told The New Stack. “This past year, we’ve witnessed significant strides in scaling Rust to deliver benefits to more developers and organizations alike.”

Meanwhile, global enthusiasm for Rust soared in 2024, with new meetup groups and conferences emerging worldwide —from [Kenya](https://github.com/RustaceansKenya) to [Turkey,](https://github.com/rustturkey) across the rest of Europe and the U.K.—reflecting the open source community’s hunger to learn about and connect over Rust, Rumbul noted. The Rust Foundation also supported some of these organizers, as well as project maintainers through its Community Grants Program.

“Institutional investment in Rust also reached new heights this year, Rumbul said. “[The White House Office of the National Cyber Director](https://thenewstack.io/rust-on-the-rise-new-advocacy-expected-to-advance-adoption/) advocated for memory-safe languages like Rust to bolster security in February. Industry leaders made bold commitments: AWS invested in Rust ecosystem security through its donation to our Security Initiative, Google’s support for our Interop Initiative will help advance [Rust-C++ interoperability](https://thenewstack.io/google-spends-1-million-to-make-rust-c-interoperable/), and [Microsoft advocated](https://thenewstack.io/microsofts-1m-vote-of-confidence-in-rusts-future/) for key Rust Project priorities via a generous unrestricted donation. These are just a few examples of enterprise investment in Rust in 2024.”

Rumbul added that there are too many contributions and packages of work on part of Rust maintainers to name, but the deep reflection on [Rust Project goals ahead of the forthcoming Rust Edition](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2024h2/Rust-2024-Edition.html) comes to mind as a clear sign of maturity, growth, and foresight.

“The entire Rust ecosystem — from Rust Project contributors to Rust community organizers, to the Rust Foundation—has made strides in 2024 that will help Rust meet a growing need and demand in 2025.”
