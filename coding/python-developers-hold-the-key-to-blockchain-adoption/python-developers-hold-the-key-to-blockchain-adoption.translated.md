In my career, I've worn many hats—from derivatives analyst to applied cryptographer—but at heart, I'm a software engineer. I've always loved coding, and like many others who call themselves "developers," I'm proficient in a variety of programming languages—common ones like Java, Swift, C, and [Rust](https://thenewstack.io/rust-the-future-of-fail-safe-software-development/), as well as a few others. So, when I became fascinated with decentralized computing as a cryptographer, following the ideas behind Bitcoin and Monero, I embraced the challenge of learning the new programming languages required to work with blockchain as a developer. Through this experience, I immediately discovered a major hurdle: the need to learn a whole new programming language. Even if that language had similarities to existing ones (like Solidity's resemblance to JavaScript syntax), it would still limit how many people could build applications for decentralized operating systems.

Fast forward to today, and the landscape has changed. Blockchain is no longer a fringe concept, but its widespread adoption still faces one obstacle: developer accessibility and user experience. We won't have decentralized applications without developers to build them; and without those applications, mass adoption won't happen. That's where [Python](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-python/)—one of the world's most widely used and in-demand coding languages—comes into play.

**Python Powers Popular Applications**

Python is an easy-to-learn and versatile language. It's a "workhorse" across industries, powering much of the internet as we know it. Instagram started as a simple photo-sharing app and has become one of the world's leading social media applications. Its backend infrastructure? Python.

Spotify, the ubiquitous music streaming service whose algorithms choose the songs we want to hear, is powered by Python. Many large language models, including ChatGPT, Meta's Llama3, and Google Gemini, rely on Python and [PyTorch](https://thenewstack.io/pytorch-takes-ai-ml-back-to-its-research-open-source-roots/) for their development and functionality. The list of industry-defining applications powered by Python continues to grow. Python's familiarity provides a sense of trust, which is key for blockchain to gain widespread acceptance and ease of use.

Blockchain programming in Python is possible, but it hasn't been well-executed. [We recently integrated Python](https://thenewstack.io/algokit-python-toolkit-for-blockchain/) as the native programming language for the Algorand blockchain. This was a significant, multi-year effort that finally resulted in a seamless native Python coding experience.

Why did we go through the time and effort to do this when we already had (like many other blockchain networks) a Python-like language called PyTEAL? We believe that true Python is one of the main avenues for enterprises to enter the blockchain space. It allows them to leverage existing resources—a pool of experienced Python developers. **They no longer need to spend more money hiring experts proficient in niche languages; their existing development teams can use their expertise to build and maintain secure, transparent, and decentralized blockchain solutions. It's this accessibility and reduced engineering cost that will help blockchain achieve mainstream adoption.**

**Blockchain: More Than Just Cryptocurrency**

When we think of blockchain, we often think of cryptocurrency—and that's reasonable, as it was the catalyst that sparked the blockchain revolution. Cryptocurrency allows for the secure and verifiable transfer of value across borders without intermediaries. However, there are many more use cases for blockchain that are waiting for enterprise developers to unlock. The problem is that developers are hesitant to jump into this Web3 technology, first because of the language barrier (which Python has solved for many), and second because there's still a lack of widespread understanding of how companies across industries can leverage blockchain in their operations.

Blockchain solves problems that traditional centralized networks struggle with—for example, secure and permanent record keeping. For most companies today, data is stored on centralized servers, making it a silo. Blockchain, on the other hand, provides verifiable, tamper-proof tracking and provenance—which is critical for permanent public records, clinical research data, supply chain logs, and decentralized identity. Many of the systems that manage this data are already built with Python. Those same developers can leverage their skills to create more secure and auditable solutions on blockchain.

**Smart Contracts: Automating Protocols**

...
当今许多区块链的另一个特点是智能合约。这些可编程合约（应用程序）根据预先确定的条件自动执行协议和交易。这使得全新的商业模式和交易类型成为可能，从而实现自动支付和文档工作流程，这些工作流程能够按照编程的方式精确执行，而不会出现故障或操纵的风险。作为我在 ConsenSys 工作的一部分，我设计了 Covantis，这是一个针对全球最大农业贸易商的交易后结算系统，它利用了智能合约——目标纯粹是运营效率。当然，智能合约的应用远不止农业：保险、房地产和法律服务等行业可以通过可编程的（如果这样，那么那样）智能合约来简化复杂流程。原子转移将这种效率提升到一个新的水平，它确保所有商定的行动都在一次交易中一起发生。这使得与从未见过面的人进行交易成为可能，但你们双方都能得到想要的东西，并且是可信的，也是有保障的。

**Python：通往 Web3 采用的路径**

这些机会仍处于早期阶段。但令人难以置信的是，区块链如何通过重新调整点对点网络中的财务关系、信任和决策来重塑整个行业或全球系统。Python 可能是打开这些可能性的关键。这就是全球 1000 万 Python 开发人员如何成为在区块链上构建未来的架构师，推动广泛采用。

区块链必须让开发人员更容易构建应用程序，以实现广泛采用。这就是为什么 Algorand，这个可编程的企业级第 1 层区块链，是第一个在语义和语法上规范的 Python 中提供原生支持的区块链。这种体验比我几年前开始区块链职业生涯时容易得多，也更易于接受。您不需要了解小众语言或拥有密码学的专业技能就可以参与；您只需要 Python。这种无与伦比的可访问性将推动区块链的采用。现在和未来都是用 Python 构建的！
