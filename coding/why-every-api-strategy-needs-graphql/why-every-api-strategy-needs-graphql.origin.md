As enterprises drive their digital transformations with
[APIs](https://thenewstack.io/api-management/), it’s clear that these interfaces have become indispensable. They help achieve business and technology objectives, overcome application challenges and connect backend systems in a reusable way.
The fact that APIs can seamlessly interact with each other is a testament to their power. Yet, despite these advantages, we’re still facing significant
[hurdles](https://thenewstack.io/graphql-growth-explodes-but-so-do-problems-federated-graphs-solve/). Why do some backend systems remain inaccessible? Why are we plagued by API sprawl and maintenance nightmares? Why do developers need to beg for custom APIs for every frontend project, only to make multiple calls to get the data they need? And why are AI projects struggling to connect with trusted systems?
While REST APIs have solved many initial problems, they’ve also introduced a new
[set of challenges](https://thenewstack.io/6-api-trends-and-practices-to-know-for-2024/) that we’re not yet equipped to tackle.
## Get Out of the Complexity Trap With GraphQL
I am here to tell you that you’re not taking advantage of all the capabilities of modern APIs.
[GraphQL](https://roadmap.sh/graphql) is the answer that will help you get more done while writing less code. Think about the costs you could reduce or avoid if your teams are writing less code, not to mention the new revenue opportunities you could pursue.
Gartner projects that by 2025, more than
[50% of enterprises will be using GraphQL APIs](https://www.ibm.com/blog/seven-key-insights-on-graphql-trends/) in production. Why are they making such a bold projection? It’s because GraphQL is going to help you do APIs in a better way.
With multiple projects spinning up, each with its own set of requirements, API teams are constantly bombarded with change requests. This creates a never-ending cycle of updates, patches and versioning, which takes away from the resources needed to drive innovation.
GraphQL offers a way out of this
[complexity](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-maintain-api-consistency-as-you-scale/) trap. By providing a unified interface and a single endpoint, GraphQL reduces the need for changes to your API portfolio. With GraphQL, you can give developers everything they need, eliminating the constant requests for updates. This means your API teams can focus on more meaningful work.
You can minimize the cost of onboarding new developer teams by giving them a GraphQL endpoint that has everything they need without the overhead of comprehensive documentation and knowledge transfers. The more you expose your backend systems to frontend teams, the slower it is for new developers to get up to speed and learn everything they need to about those systems. GraphQL’s unified interface and single endpoint make it easier for frontend developers to build apps, reducing development time and costs.
GraphQL’s self-documenting nature also reduces the need for extensive documentation, saving you time and resources. No more maintaining multiple sets of API docs or worrying about versioning issues because versioning becomes less frequent with GraphQL, reducing the need for costly maintenance.
## 3 Advantages of Using GraphQL
GraphQL offers a triple threat of benefits that can lead to increased revenue: reduced costs and complexity, accelerated time to market and better products delivered faster.
Like
[SQL](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-write-sql-queries/), which revolutionized data querying by allowing users to request specific data without manual table-by-table searches, GraphQL provides a dynamic query language that retrieves data from multiple APIs and sources in a single call. This streamlined approach enables faster development cycles, empowering frontend developers to build apps quickly and iterate rapidly.
With GraphQL, teams can collaborate more effectively thanks to its schema-driven approach, which fosters a shared understanding of the data model and reduces misunderstandings. Integration time is also significantly reduced, as GraphQL’s flexibility and adaptability make it easier to incorporate with existing systems and services.
Moreover, GraphQL’s agile iteration capabilities allow API teams to respond swiftly to changing business requirements and customer needs, providing a flexible and adaptable data layer that enables confident, rapid iteration without breaking existing APIs or disrupting the system.
If you want more flexible and performant APIs while writing less code, then GraphQL should be a key part of your API strategy.
