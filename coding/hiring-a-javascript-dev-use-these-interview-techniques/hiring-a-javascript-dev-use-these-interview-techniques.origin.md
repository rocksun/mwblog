You decided to hire a [JavaScript](https://thenewstack.io/whats-new-for-javascript-developers-in-ecmascript-2024/) developer. You want them to be perfect all around — to navigate JS’s crazy ecosystem, to have deep expertise in your technology of choice, and to be fluent in core computer science principles. Yes, another flavor of the [Iron Triangle](https://thenewstack.io/break-the-kubernetes-iron-triangle-by-optimizing-your-apps/), and we can’t have it all. But can’t we try?

In this article, I wanted to share [our experience](https://www.freshcodeit.com/blog/building-a-javascript-team-freshcodes-experience) interviewing developers and the methods we use to determine where a candidate falls within the said triangle. However, it’s important to establish some foundational understanding first.

## What Do We Look for?
Some skills are not negotiable. Many thanks to Chirag Jain, who distilled them into an evident and handy list:

- Problem-solving,
- Critical thinking,
- Continuous learning,
- Team spirit,
- Self-management.
So, these are the must-haves for an engineer in any niche.

## What Do* You* Look for?
It depends on your specific case. What a revelation, I know. Still, you look for someone to solve a problem, so profiling the problem outlines the required skill set. Keeping it short and sweet, I prefer **UNPHAT** (another batch of gratitude here goes to Oz Nova, whose article on technology choice inspired me). It stands for **U**nderstand, e**N**umerate, **P**aper, **H**istorical context, **A**dvantages, and **T**hink!

### Let’s Recontextualize It a Little for Our Needs:
**Understand**the problem: What specific challenges is your project facing? Are you building a high-performance web application, maintaining a legacy codebase, or creating a new framework?**Enumerate**multiple solutions and consider different approaches to solving your problem. Could it be addressed by a specialist in a particular framework or someone with broad ecosystem knowledge?- Research
**papers**(or documentation) of the technologies and methodologies relevant to your problem. This could involve reading documentation for specific frameworks or studying best practices for your application type. - Consider the
**historical context**of your project. What experience would perfectly match your project’s current state and future direction? For instance, a[developer with experience in jQuery and modern frameworks like React](https://thenewstack.io/framework-lets-react-developers-create-video-with-code/)or Vue might be ideal if you’re modernizing a large jQuery codebase. If you’re building an application with the latest technologies, someone with a history of early adoption and quick learning might be more suitable. - Weigh the
**pros and cons**of different developer profiles. A React expert might be perfect for your project, but consider what you might be sacrificing regarding broader JavaScript knowledge or core CS skills. - Soberly
**evaluate**how different developer profiles would fit your needs. What facts would need to change for you to prioritize one area of expertise over another?
## What *Exactly *Do You Look for?
It’s time to combine those (and here’s where we hit the Iron Trilemma). Ideally, you’d want a developer who excels in all three areas, but such candidates are rare and often come at a premium. More realistically, you’ll [need to prioritize based on your project](https://thenewstack.io/does-your-open-source-project-need-foundation-oversight/) needs (as identified through your UNPHAT analysis) while ensuring the candidate possesses the non-negotiable skills we discussed earlier.

Let’s explore how this might play out in different scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Startup Building a New Product**
**UNPHAT Outcome:**Need for rapid development and flexibility**Prioritized Area**: General JS knowledge**Why**: Prioritize a developer who can quickly adapt to changing requirements and isn’t locked into a single technology. Their broad knowledge allows them to make informed decisions about which tools to use as the product evolves.
**Scenario 2: Enterprise Modernizing Legacy System**
**UNPHAT Outcome**: Need for specific expertise to handle complex migration**Prioritized Area**: Specific expertise**Why**: If you’re migrating from an old jQuery codebase to React, you might prioritize someone with deep React expertise, including experience with large-scale migrations.
**Scenario 3: Tech Company Building Developer Tools**
**UNPHAT Outcome**: Need for optimized, efficient solutions**Prioritized Area**: Strong computer science fundamentals**Why**: A strong foundation in CS principles is crucial when building tools other developers will use. This ensures your products are well-architected, efficient, and can handle complex use cases.
In each scenario, the non-negotiable skills (problem-solving, critical thinking, etc.) remain constant, but the technical focus shifts based on the specific needs identified through UNPHAT.

### Balancing the Trilemma
While you may prioritize one area, it doesn’t mean you completely ignore the others. Here’s how you might balance them:

- Use your UNPHAT analysis to
**prioritize based on immediate needs**and determine which area is most critical for your current project. - A candidate who is strong in your priority area and shows aptitude in the others might be ideal. Their ability to learn and adapt (one of our non-negotiable skills) is key here.
**Look for growth potential and a problem-solving approach.** **Consider team composition**. If you already have deep, specific expertise on your team, you might prioritize broader knowledge or CS fundamentals to round out the team’s skill set.
## Constructing an Interview
Now to the meat and potatoes. How exactly do you identify your Mx. Big Hire? Here’s a toolkit of assessment methods. Choose and combine the ones that best align with your needs.
