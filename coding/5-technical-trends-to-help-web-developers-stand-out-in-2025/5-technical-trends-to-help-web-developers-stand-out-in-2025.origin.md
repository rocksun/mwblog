2024 has been an eventful year in the world of web development. Around [70% of devs came to terms with the presence of AI](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/ai#3-are-ai-tools-a-threat-to-your-job), somewhat quelling the industry-wide fear that arose. There will be more of the same in 2025, but what about other, lesser-known, technical trends in web development? What will set you apart from other, perhaps already AI-dependent, developers?

The following five technical trends represent pivotal shifts shaping the future of web development, and they will help you differentiate from other developers as we head into a new year.

## 1. Don’t Underestimate the Power of Vanilla JS
Vanilla JavaScript is seeing a resurgence in importance as developers realize the value of lean, dependency-free code.

Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue dominate the web, [but they can add unnecessary complexity to simple projects](https://thenewstack.io/frontend-strategies-frameworks-or-pure-javascript/). A solid foundation in Vanilla JS not only reduces bloat but also enhances a developer’s ability to troubleshoot and optimize code across the stack.

Now, of course, this doesn’t mean we should be cavemen and insist on JS purism, but one can’t deny the overreliance on frameworks and their effect on web performance.

Consider this example of a straightforward image slider implemented with pure JavaScript:

Usually, [one would use Swiper](https://refine.dev/blog/swiper-js/), Slick or even Glide.js to perform this action, adding extra parts to the equation. But by using Vanilla JS, you maintain full control over the implementation without the overhead of additional libraries. Such an approach is not only lightweight but also fosters a deeper understanding of core web principles.

## 2. Traditional Resumes Are Dead; Use Three.js
With everyone using AI, it’s not enough to send a text resume if you want to stand out as a developer. Sure, [you want it to be ATS-friendly](https://www.finaldraftresumes.com/post/how-to-properly-format-an-ats-friendly-resume), but what about your actual work? What can you create? What are you proud of?

A compelling developer portfolio can set you apart in a competitive market, and Three.js offers an unparalleled way [to create visually stunning, interactive web experiences](https://dev.to/hr21don/six-stunning-web-developer-portfolios-showcasing-threejs-mastery-206n).

Resumes are no longer static documents; they’re live demonstrations of your technical skills. A [well-executed Three.js project](https://thenewstack.io/top-10-javascript-libraries-to-use-in-2024/) can showcase your mastery of modern web technologies while leaving a lasting impression on potential employers.

Here’s a basic example to create an interactive rotating cube:

The great thing about Three.js is that it allows you to use custom textures and shaders, [as well as import your own models from Blender](https://threejs.org/docs/manual/en/introduction/Loading-3D-models.html). As you master this approach to JS, you’ll also start incorporating interactive elements like user-controlled animations or dynamic data visualizations.

## 3. Security Knowledge Is Becoming More Important
In 2022 alone, companies [spent more than $70 billion on cybersecurity](https://bluetree.digital/cybersecurity-market-growth/), with that number expected to rise even further. This just goes to show that security is no longer an optional consideration. Developers [can’t afford to be mere coders](https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/vulnerability-management-threat-hunting/front-end-security) and be ignorant of the real-world consequences of their creators.

We need to stay informed about common vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and insecure API configurations. Proactive security measures can save organizations from costly breaches and protect users from harm, and developers adept in these measures will always be one step ahead.

For instance, content security policies (CSP) [are one way to mitigate XSS attacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), and you can implement them as follows:

Other than creating better websites, there’s another benefit — security-conscious developers are increasingly [valued for their ability to preemptively address threats](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382695405_Balancing_Usability_and_Security_in_Secure_System_Design_A_Comprehensive_Study_on_Principles_Implementation_and_Impact_on_Usability).

Not to mention, working in specific niches inherently demands knowledge of security. How would you work for a fintech company without knowing how [to set up PCI-compliant hosting](https://www.atlantic.net/pci-compliant-hosting/)? Would a hospital website dev [not know HIPAA](https://thenewstack.io/5-strategies-for-cloud-security-in-healthcare/)?

This can facilitate collaboration with DevOps and security teams, resulting in a treasure trove of new knowledge, networking opportunities, and career advancement pathways.

## 4. The Future of AI Coding Assistants Is Local
Coding assistants [have taken web development by storm](https://thenewstack.io/a-developer-health-check-on-github-copilot-and-ai-assistants/), with GitHub Copilot and other mainstream solutions sitting at the forefront.

Far from the public eye, however, [the rise of open source, local LLMs for coding](https://thenewstack.io/coding-with-slms-and-local-llms-tips-and-recommendations/) represents a paradigm shift in how developers interact with AI tools. Cloud-based AI assistants have dominated the space, but local models offer distinct advantages — including enhanced privacy, reduced latency, and customizable environments.

Running models locally allows developers to maintain full control over sensitive data while avoiding dependency on external APIs. Tools like [Ollama](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-set-up-and-run-a-local-llm-with-ollama-and-llama-2/) make this process straightforward, enabling seamless setup and management of open source models. It’s as easy as:

When running locally, models [operate and depend directly on your hardware](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recommended-hardware-for-running-llms-locally/), eliminating latency introduced by network calls. This is particularly useful for iterative tasks where speed and responsiveness are critical. Furthermore, local deployments provide the flexibility to fine-tune models for specific tasks or integrate them tightly with your development workflows.

For example, developers can combine locally running models with automation scripts to create a coding assistant tailored to their needs:

This approach highlights the transformative potential of local models. They enable advanced AI-assisted development while offering greater privacy and customization than their cloud-based counterparts. Once we get more powerful models, they’ll become standard “[rubber ducks](https://thenewstack.io/7-guiding-principles-for-working-with-llms/)” for devs on both PCs and mobile devices.

## 5. Don’t Ignore No-Code and Low-Code Tools
Did you know that companies report [saving up to 70% on development when employing no-code solutions](https://tadabase.io/blog/33-no-code-statistics-and-facts-in-2024)? With AI making [Python](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-python/) scripts, basic CSS and even self-made courses available to anyone, it’s time we faced the music.

If we, as devs, are to thrive in 2025 and beyond, we must learn how to combine our knowledge with the usability of no-code platforms. Webflow, Xano and even Backendless are shortcuts, not career changers.

Don’t be afraid that these tools will put your career in peril. Instead, look at it this way: no-code and low-code platforms are transforming how applications are built, lowering barriers for non-technical stakeholders while accelerating development timelines. These tools enable developers to focus on complex backend logic and integrations, while allowing teams to quickly prototype and iterate.

While some developers may initially view these tools with skepticism, their ability to streamline processes and expand access to digital creation cannot be ignored.

## Stay Nimble in 2025
The trajectory of web development is as dynamic as ever. With the rapid pace of change, developers must remain adaptable, continuously learning and embracing new tools and practices. From leveraging the simplicity of Vanilla JS to exploring the power of local AI models, there are plenty of opportunities to stand out as a developer.

Staying ahead means not only understanding current trends, but also anticipating future shifts. By adopting these practices and integrating them into your workflow, you solidify your role as a forward-thinking developer ready to tackle the challenges of a fast-evolving digital world.
