As digital infrastructure continues to become more complex and distributed, developers are increasingly burdened with tasks that extend far beyond just writing code. The demands of managing diverse [data sources](https://thenewstack.io/data/), while delivering real-time, scalable applications, as well as experimenting with new tools to drive innovation, is pushing development teams to their limits. For organizations, the impact is severe. Customers often vote with their feet if digital experiences do not meet their expectations.

[Despite investment in AI tools to help developer workloads](https://www.couchbase.com/blog/cio-survey-digital-modernization-in-2025/), teams struggle to meet these expectations for agile, innovative applications that can make an organization’s product “sticky” with users. The current barriers to developer productivity can be grouped into three categories:
**Data Complexity**
Delivering sophisticated applications significantly increases the complexity of [managing data](https://thenewstack.io/agile-data-management-explained-and-demystified/). Development teams often find themselves working with vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. This data is often spread across multiple environments, including on-premises systems, cloud services and hybrid architectures. Traditional databases designed for monolithic architectures can still perform intended tasks perfectly — and in some cases are required given specific privacy, security or legal regulations.

However in other cases, traditional data infrastructure can struggle to handle the flexibility required by modern microservices-based applications, which adds to the complexity.

As a result, developers must spend more time tuning current legacy databases for increased performance, dealing with scaling issues and ensuring high availability across regions. Persistent challenges also arise with the demand for services like real-time data processing and edge computing — crucial for effective AI powered applications.

**Rising Development Costs**
The financial burden of developing and testing [cloud native AI applications](https://thenewstack.io/open-source-ai-what-about-data-transparency/) continues to grow. Developers require environments that can handle a production-level workload during testing, but the costs associated with cloud services can often increase during this stage.

In fact, for teams working in agile environments, where iterative testing and continuous integration are the norm, these expenses can quickly become unsustainable for the business. Some organizations are unable to justify high upfront infrastructure costs for AI applications that are still in development or experimental phases. And without access to affordable yet robust solutions, many teams find themselves cutting corners, potentially reducing the quality of their applications.

**Weighing Up Database Choices**
While some organizations rely on traditional databases for operational stability or customized solutions, others require greater flexibility in data management. This need is particularly pronounced in sectors like retail and financial services, where developers must pivot quickly to respond to evolving customer demands or market shifts. Legacy systems in these environments often enforce rigid schema structures, which can restrict developers’ ability to adapt to changing requirements without extensive reworking.

**The Lasting Impact**
The ripple effect of these challenges on development cycles is substantial. Developers waste time and resources managing database infrastructure rather than focusing on delivering new features or improving user experiences. Lengthy setup processes, extensive tuning requirements and escalating [cloud costs stifle innovation](https://thenewstack.io/how-finops-can-optimize-cloud-costs-and-drive-innovation/).

The lack of flexibility in traditional database solutions also forces teams to spend significant time overhauling systems as they no longer meet requirements. These challenges not only hinder developer productivity but also introduce long-term technical debt that can be costly to address.

To maintain a competitive edge, development teams need agile, scalable and cost-effective solutions that allow them to innovate without being bogged down by infrastructure complexities. The current demand for AI applications only increases the demand for modern data management features from developers — such as real-time data analytics.

Unless developer productivity is unleashed, innovation across digital services will suffer, and organizations could face an exodus of users or customers as a result.

[Couchbase Capella](https://www.couchbase.com/products/capella/) is a flexible, NoSQL model that is built to handle both structured and unstructured data seamlessly, while boosting developer productivity. Its distributed architecture allows developers to manage complex datasets without needing to compromise on performance or scale, and enables development teams to focus on building applications rather than managing infrastructure.
Now, with the addition of [Capella Free Tier](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up), developers can gain free access to the service to experiment and build new projects, without the financial, time or flexibility constraints that often block creativity. Developers can use the feature to activate new clusters, evaluate and explore products, and develop and test applications without worrying about an end date before scaling up to larger deployments within Capella.
