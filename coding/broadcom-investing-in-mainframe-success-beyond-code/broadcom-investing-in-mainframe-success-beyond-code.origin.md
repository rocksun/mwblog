[Broadcom](https://thenewstack.io/why-broadcom-is-killing-off-vmwares-standalone-products/)’s [mainframe software](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering-for-a-mainframe-design-thinking-drives-change/) division is on a mission to help customers realize maximum value from their mainframe investments, and in so doing, sustain a profitable mainframe software business. [Greg Lotko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-lotko-867b901/), senior vice president and general manager of Broadcom’s, [Mainframe Software Division](https://mainframe.broadcom.com/), explained how it all works at their recent Broadcom Mainframe analyst conference last week in Boston.
When planning their investments in products and services, they start by listening to what customers need and asking them to describe their challenges. To address the challenge of available mainframe skills, for example, Broadcom Mainframe Software
[invests in recruiting and training new staff](https://mainframe.broadcom.com/workforce-resiliency-programs), and placing them with customers at no charge.
## Modernizing the Developer Toolchain
They invest in
[modernizing the developer toolchain](https://mainframe.broadcom.com/devops) for mainframe developers to present familiar options for newcomers, such as [Git](https://thenewstack.io/git-at-15-how-git-changed-the-way-we-code/) integration, [CI/CD](https://thenewstack.io/ci-cd/) pipelines, and [automated testing](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-based-automated-testing-increases-speed-in-a-flash/). Developers who still want to use greenscreens, [CLI](https://thenewstack.io/introducing-the-github-cli/), and [Endevor](https://www.broadcom.com/products/mainframe/application-development/endevor) directly can do so as well.
In contrast to
[Computer Associates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA_Technologies) before the [Broadcom acquisition](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-completes-acquisition-ca-technologies) and subsequent rebranding as Broadcom Mainframe, the Broadcom Mainframe Software division invests in synergies across their product offerings, such as a common modern UI framework to improve the user experience, and using open APIs to integrate products with each other and with third-party products.
## Investing in Product Synergies and Integration
Broadcom Mainframe Software invests in a broad range of products from
[legacy databases](https://thenewstack.io/amazon-web-services-wants-you-to-migrate-off-legacy-databases/) dating back to 1972 to modern [observability](https://thenewstack.io/observability/) products, driven by calculating the value of those investments to their customers.
One recent example is a “flexible storage”
[product called CA 1](https://mainframe.broadcom.com/flexible-storage) that lets customers store [mainframe data](https://thenewstack.io/happens-use-java-1960-ibm-mainframe/) in the cloud, on tape, or elsewhere.
Often, they provide a customer with a beta version of a new capability and build out the complete product together with one or more of the early customers to be sure they are on the right track, Lotko said.
Some of the products and services are profitable, while others are not. But this is ok because in the aggregate the business is profitable, and the products and services that are not directly profitable help customers and therefore indirectly help drive profit for the rest of the portfolio.
They are investing in data access, security,
[GenAI](https://thenewstack.io/generative-ai-in-2023-genai-tools-became-table-stakes/), and services “beyond code” to help customers migrate to new versions (for free) and manage change more carefully to prevent common change-related outages.
## Blurring the Lines Between Vendor and Customer Challenges
The ECP (
[expert change program](https://www.mainframe.broadcom.com/expert-change-planning)) reduces outages and improves customer satisfaction — the bet is that this will help promote customer loyalty and generate profitable software revenue sufficient to fund these types of customer assistance programs.
Another aspect of mutual benefit is providing a service to help a customer migrate to a new version of a product. This helps the customer stay current and helps the vendor drop legacy version support.
This is all a big change from the approach at CA prior to the acquisition. Individual product units were evaluated solely on their own revenue targets, regardless of whether there was overlap in the feature set of whether the salespeople were selling the right product, or whether the customer even used the product at all. Success at Broadcom Mainframe Software is counted when the customer actually uses the product, Lotko said.
Broadcom management appears to be not just tolerating this approach based on what the mainframe folks call its independent subsidiary or independent franchise business model, but actually actively encouraging it with approval of a significant investment budget item list.
In this business model, customer challenges become Broadcom Mainframe Software’s challenges as well — it does not appear to be following the traditional dividing line at which things become customer problems, such as software upgrades, recruiting skilled staff, training existing staff, planning application changes and updates, and recovering from incidents and outages,
As mainframes become increasingly relevant as reliable data and transaction servers for
[mobile and web applications](https://thenewstack.io/project-idx-googles-new-web-and-mobile-app-development-ide/), through this approach Broadcom Mainframe Software is positioning itself to become the preferred partner for mainframe customers. [
