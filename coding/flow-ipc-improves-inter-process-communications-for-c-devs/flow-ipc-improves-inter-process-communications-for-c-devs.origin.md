Inter-process communication (IPC) is crucial for modern computing, enabling multiple processor cores to execute threads simultaneously. Essentially, IPC allows different threads, or even separate programs, to share data efficiently. For instance, when you’re streaming a video, one thread might handle video decoding while another handles rendering.

The challenge arises when these threads are operating in different programs, such as a web server and a security server. Traditional methods of transferring [large data volumes](https://thenewstack.io/data/) between these programs can be slow and inefficient, often due to the way different operating systems manage memory. Open source [Flow-IPC](https://www.akamai.com/blog/developers/flow-ipc-introduction-low-latency-cpp-toolkit) addresses this challenge by making IPC fast and straightforward for C++ developers.

**Flow-IPC: An Open Source Project**
Akamai’s acquisition of Linode in 2022 marked a strategic acceleration toward cloud native computing. We’re including upstream contributions and advocating for open source as part of our business strategy. In that spirit, we [introduced Flow-IPC](https://www.akamai.com/blog/developers/flow-ipc-introduction-low-latency-cpp-toolkit) earlier this year. It’s open source [middleware](https://thenewstack.io/case-containerizing-middleware/) (Apache 2.0 and MIT licenses) designed specifically to help C++ programmers streamline their IPC.

Flow-IPC started as an internal tool at Akamai used in a project for which we needed to split a large application without compromising performance. Existing IPC solutions were either too slow or too complex. From the outset, we designed Flow-IPC to be a general solution for IPC in C++. [Making Flow-IPC open source](https://www.linode.com/blog/open-source/flow-ipc-introduction-low-latency-cpp-toolkit/) and sharing it with the developer community is a way to foster innovation and make life simpler for any developer who [needs to use C++](https://thenewstack.io/google-spends-1-million-to-make-rust-c-interoperable/) to manage multiple threads in sharing data.

We [launched Flow-IPC](https://www.linode.com/blog/open-source/flow-ipc-introduction-low-latency-cpp-toolkit/) publicly in April 2024, and the project received a strong response on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40028118) and other community platforms. Developers shared their own IPC challenges and solutions, leading to constructive discussions and valuable feedback.

Flow-IPC is designed for a broad audience within the server-side systems development community. While it currently focuses on C++, there is potential for expansion into other programming environments. Likewise, it currently supports Linux running on x86-64. We have plans to expand this project to macOS and ARM64, followed by Windows and other OS variants, depending on demand.

Flow-IPC is a library with an extensible C++17 API that is currently available for communication locally across process boundaries. It is hosted on GitHub along with full documentation, automated tests and demos, and a CI pipeline that tests across a range of GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and Clang compiler versions and build configurations, including hardening via runtime sanitizers such as ASan (hardens against memory misuse), TSan (against race conditions) and UBSan (against miscellaneous undefined behavior).

**Comparing Flow-IPC to Other Solutions**
[Flow-IPC](https://tfir.io/akamais-open-source-project-flow-ipc-solves-ipc-latency-challenges-in-c/) offers simplicity and efficiency. Unlike general solutions like gRPC, which are elegant but can introduce latency, Flow-IPC minimizes data copying and integrates seamlessly into existing systems. Traditional IPC introduces latency based on the payload size; in our tests, transfer speeds have reached into the one-second range. Flow-IPC can transmit data structure payloads as large as 1GB just as quickly as a 100KB payload — in microseconds. This is an improvement of as much as three or four orders of magnitude. A commercial-grade memory allocator is integrated with shared memory to further boost performance.
**Future Prospects**
We are excited to see where the community takes [Flow-IPC](https://sdtimes.com/softwaredev/sd-times-open-source-project-of-the-week-flow-ipc/). Contributions, feature requests and bug reports are welcome as we continue to develop and refine the project.

We have ideas with excellent potential for future development. In the short term, integration with [capnp-rpc](https://capnproto.org/rpc.html) and possibly [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) is a no-brainer. The protocol and API would remain what one expects from those elegant frameworks, while Flow-IPC would provide the underlying zero-copy performance. Longer-term, with its extensible design, Flow-IPC could expand to networked IPC, and furthermore, ultra-fast LAN performance is possible with remote direct memory access (RDMA).

Flow-IPC is gaining traction in the open source community, and we’re looking forward to collaborating with C++ developers to make it even better. It’s one example of the kinds of projects we’re working on to bring our technology to developers globally via open source models.
