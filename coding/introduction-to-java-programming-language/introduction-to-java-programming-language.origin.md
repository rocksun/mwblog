In Java, memory allocation and deallocation are handled automatically using garbage collection. The JVM regularly eliminates objects to free up memory space and prevent memory leaks and associated problems. This system of memory management streamlines development processes and boosts the stability of applications.

## Advantages of Using Java
### Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)
One of the benefits of Java is its principle known as “Write Run Anywhere” (WORA). This concept ensures that after compiling a Java program, it can function on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), regardless of the hardware and operating system it runs on. This compatibility across platforms streamlines the deployment process and minimizes the resources needed for adapting applications to environments.

### Security Features and Robustness
Java prioritizes security as a feature. It incorporates security measures, like the Java sandbox, which limits the running of code, and bytecode verification to validate code against Java language standards.
