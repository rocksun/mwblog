Way back in the 90s, I was studying [C++](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-c-programming-language/) at a local college. Everyone in the class but me had a [Windows](https://thenewstack.io/ebpf-is-coming-for-windows/) machine. As for myself, I was already a hardcore [Linux](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-linux-operating-system/) user, and there was nothing the professor could say that would sway me back to Windows.

Even though he suggested using [Microsoft Visual Basic](https://thenewstack.io/visual-basic-lingers-on/) at the time, I was certain I could get through the class using [Linux and the command line](https://thenewstack.io/tns-linux-sb00-3-understand-the-linux-command-line/).

I did, but it took a bit of work at the beginning. In the end, I completed the course with an A and then promptly forgot everything I’d learned.

Well, not everything.

One thing that stuck with me was that developing from the command line is certainly an option with both pros and cons (just like when using a [GUI](https://thenewstack.io/guis-cli-apis-learn-basic-terms-of-infrastructure-as-code/)). What are those pros and cons? Let’s dive in and find out.

## Pros
First, we’ll look at the pros, of which there are plenty to make you think about dropping that GUI.

### Lower Hardware Requirements
This is a big one for a lot of people. Some [IDEs](https://thenewstack.io/best-open-source-ides/) are fairly resource-intensive. The command line… not so much. In fact, you can develop using the command line on any old machine capable of running Linux. Compile times are even faster when working from the command line. Because of this, you don’t have to dole out the cash for a top-of-the-line PC to use as a development station. And with so many Linux distributions available for older hardware, even that old machine collecting dust can be of value.

So don’t get caught up in the idea that you have to have the latest greatest hardware for developing, because the command line gives you far more options that are far cheaper.

### Better Understanding of How Things Work
One thing I learned during that C++ class was how things worked together to create a cohesive whole. Instead of allowing a GUI IDE to do everything, I had to piece together all the bits to create a workstation capable of working with the programming language for the class. In the end, I had a much better understanding of how it all came together (languages, compilers, debuggers, everything) to make it possible to [develop, compile and run applications](https://thenewstack.io/3-recommended-low-code-tools-for-application-development/).

### More Efficient Workflow
One of the cool things that happened during my time with C++ was that I developed an incredibly fast workflow. Instead of moving my hand between keyboard and mouse, I was able to do everything from the keyboard, which led me to create a very efficient workflow. I would often work with other students and found myself getting things done much faster than everyone else, due to the simplicity of how I worked. Once you’ve created an effective command line workflow, it’s hard to match it with a GUI. And given you can use [Git](https://thenewstack.io/linus-torvalds-reflects-on-20-years-of-git/) from the command line, there’s really nothing you can’t do at a very high level of efficiency.

### More Flexible Remote Work
One really amazing thing I can do with the command line is [SSH](https://thenewstack.io/linux-ssh-and-key-based-authentication/) into a remote machine and do everything I need, without leaving my desk. That means I could develop on my local machine, or secure shell into a remote machine and do the same thing. I could even open multiple terminal windows (or use a terminal app with tabs) and remote into multiple machines and develop on them all during the same session. Yes, there are GUIs that allow you to connect to remote desktops, but getting that to work effectively can be a challenge. With [Linux and SSH](https://thenewstack.io/linux-run-a-single-command-across-multiple-servers-with-ssh/), it’s all right there at your disposal, ready to go.

### Cost Effectiveness
Developing from the command line is cheap. Think about it: You don’t have to purchase a single piece of software because it’s all right there, built into the OS. Although there are plenty of IDEs that are free or cheap, when you add it all up (including the lower hardware requirements), it all comes down to a very cost-effective method of developing.

## Cons
Okay, so it’s not all unicorns and rainbows over here in command line land. Here are a few cons you must consider before diving in.

### Steeper Learning Curve
When I was taking that class, the first few days were a struggle because I not only had to learn how to do things from the command line, but I also had to figure out all of the pieces required to make it work. I needed [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), GCC+, [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and a bunch of other command line tools. On top of that, I had to learn (and memorize) the command line required to compile and debug the apps I’d built. It wasn’t exactly easy, but it was a hurdle I overcame within a couple of days.

### Requires a Bit More Work
It’s not just about the steeper learning curve, but there’s also just a bit more involved. Instead of clicking a button, you have to type a command. Instead of installing searchable plugins, you have to know everything required to take care of the task at hand. All of that means you’re going to have to do a bit more work up front. The good news is that, once you’ve done all that work, everything very quickly smooths out and you’re off to the races.

### Fewer Integrations
Many IDEs include tons of integrations. If they don’t include them out of the box, you can add them via plugins. The command line doesn’t work that way. If you need to integrate something into your workflow, it might take a bit of futzing around to make it happen. You might have to chase down the right libraries and figure out how to install them. In the end, if your project depends on a ton of IDE integrations, you might find yourself struggling to get things done from the command line.

## Conclusion
In the end, I felt very fortunate that I was able to get through the class using nothing but the command line for C++ development. I felt I learned more about the process, understood how the language worked and was able to get things done with a level of efficiency I could match using a GUI.
