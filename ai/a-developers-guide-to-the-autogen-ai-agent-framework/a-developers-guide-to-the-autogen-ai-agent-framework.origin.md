[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/) is a popular framework among Python developers for building multi-agent AI systems through sophisticated, conversation-driven collaboration and human-in-the-loop capabilities.
Developed by [Microsoft Research](https://news.microsoft.com/?utm_content=inline+mention), open source AutoGen stands out for its flexible agent architecture, advanced conversation management, and secure code execution features. The framework enables developers to create complex multi-agent systems where agents can engage in dynamic conversations, execute code in secure environments and seamlessly integrate human feedback into their workflows.

Similar to how I [introduced CrewAI,](https://thenewstack.io/developer-guide-to-the-crewai-agent-framework-for-python/) I will use the [AI agent anatomy](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-a-comprehensive-introduction-for-developers/) I defined in one of my previous articles.

## AutoGen and the Anatomy of an AI Agent
AutoGen implements the key components of AI agent anatomy through its sophisticated architecture, enabling the creation of versatile and powerful multi-agent systems. Let’s explore how AutoGen incorporates each essential element:

**Persona **
AutoGen allows developers to create distinct agent personas through its flexible agent configuration system. Each agent can be defined with specific roles, capabilities, and personality traits that influence their behavior and decision-making processes. For example:

1234567891011 |
coding_agent = AssistantAgent( name="Python Developer", system_message="Expert Python developer with focus on code quality and optimization", llm_config={"temperature": 0.7})reviewer_agent = AssistantAgent( name="Code Reviewer", system_message="Senior developer specialized in code review and best practices", llm_config={"temperature": 0.2}) |
Notice how the `system_message`
is used to define the persona of the agent. These personas create a foundation for specialized behavior and expertise in the multi-agent system.
**Instruction**
AutoGen implements instruction handling through its sophisticated message-passing system. Agents can receive, interpret and act on complex instructions while maintaining context throughout the conversation flow:

123456789101112131415161718 |
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent( name="User_Proxy", system_message="A proxy for human user, providing project requirements and feedback.", human_input_mode="TERMINATE", code_execution_config={"work_dir": "coding_project"})coding_agent = AssistantAgent( name="Coding_Assistant", system_message="You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in writing Python scripts with robust error handling.", llm_config={"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4o"}]})# Initiate the chat with the taskuser_proxy.initiate_chat( recipient=coding_agent, message="Develop a Python script for processing CSV files with error handling") |
**Tasks**
Tasks in AutoGen are managed through its conversation-driven architecture. Agents can handle complex tasks through multiturn conversations and nested workflows.

12345678910 |
async def development_workflow(): # Initial code development code_response = await coding_agent.generate_response(task_message) # Code review phase review_response = await reviewer_agent.review_code(code_response) # Iterative improvement based on review if review_response.has_feedback: improved_code = await coding_agent.update_code(review_response.feedback) |
AutoGen’s task management system supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution patterns.
**Planning **
AutoGen implements sophisticated planning capabilities through multiple approaches: structured group conversations, [ReAct](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/topics/prompting-and-reasoning/react) (Reasoning and Acting) patterns, and [reflection-based](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/topics/prompting-and-reasoning/reflection) decision-making. Developers can choose a specific prompt engineering technique that’s aligned with the use case and use it with the agent.

The code snippet below demonstrates how an AutoGen agent uses a ReAct prompt to solve a problem.

1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829 |
ReAct_prompt = """Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to tools provided.Use the following format:Question: the input question you must answerThought: you should always think about what to doAction: the action to takeAction Input: the input to the actionObservation: the result of the action... (this process can repeat multiple times)Thought: I now know the final answerFinal Answer: the final answer to the original input questionBegin!Question: {input}"""# Define the ReAct prompt message. Assuming a "question" field is present in the contextdef react_prompt_message(sender, recipient, context): return ReAct_prompt.format(input=context["question"]) user_proxy.initiate_chat( assistant, message=react_prompt_message, question="What is the result of super bowl 2024?", ) |
**Caching and Memory**
AutoGen offers robust caching and memory capabilities that enhance agent performance and contextual awareness. The framework supports multiple memory types, including short-term, long-term, semantic, and episodic memory, enabling agents to maintain context and learn from previous interactions. Its caching mechanism allows API requests to be reused, improving reproducibility and reducing computational costs.

AutoGen provides flexible long-term memory support through seamless integration with advanced memory management platforms like [Zep](https://www.getzep.com) and [Mem0](https://www.mem0.ai/). By leveraging these external memory systems, AutoGen agents can maintain persistent context, retrieve relevant historical information, and enhance long-term reasoning capabilities.

Zep’s temporal knowledge graph and Mem0’s hybrid database approach can be directly plugged into AutoGen’s agent architecture, allowing for sophisticated memory management that goes beyond traditional context window limitations. This approach empowers developers to create more contextually aware and adaptive AI agents to learn, remember, and reason across complex interaction scenarios.

The following code snippet demonstrates how Mem0 is integrated with AutoGen:

1234 |
memory = MemoryClient(api_key="mem0_key") # Initialize Mem0 memory clientmemory.add(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Query about TV issue"}], user_id="case_123") # Store memorymemories = memory.search("TV issue", user_id="case_123") # Retrieve relevant memoriesagent.generate_reply(messages=[{"content": f"Context: {memories}", "role": "user"}]) # Use in agent response |
**Tools**
AutoGen provides robust [tool integration](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/tutorial/tool-use) capabilities, enabling agents to seamlessly interact with external tools, APIs, and custom functions. Developers can register [Python functions](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-define-and-use-your-own-functions-in-python/), command-line tools, or external APIs directly into the agent’s configuration, allowing dynamic tool invocation during conversations. The framework supports automatic tool selection, parameter inference and result interpretation, making complex multistep tasks more manageable.

1234567891011121314 |
def calculator(operation, x, y): if operation == 'add': return x + y if operation == 'subtract': return x - y if operation == 'multiply': return x * yassistant = AssistantAgent( name="Math_Assistant", llm_config={ "config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4"}], "tools": [ {"function": calculator, "name": "math_operations"} ] }) |
This example demonstrates how easily developers can integrate custom functions as tools, enabling agents to dynamically execute complex tasks across various domains with minimal configuration overhead.
**Delegation**
AutoGen’s delegation mechanism enables sophisticated multi-agent collaboration through intelligent task routing and dynamic role assignment. Agents can autonomously delegate tasks to the most appropriate team member based on expertise, current context and task complexity. The framework supports both explicit and implicit delegation strategies, allowing agents to hand off subtasks, request specialized knowledge or collaborate on complex problem-solving. Delegation occurs through intelligent routing mechanisms that evaluate agent capabilities, system messages, and previous interaction histories.

1234567891011121314151617181920 |
coding_agent = AssistantAgent( name="Python_Developer", system_message="Expert in writing Python code with strong algorithmic skills", llm_config={"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4"}]})reviewer_agent = AssistantAgent( name="Code_Reviewer", system_message="Specialized in code quality assessment and optimization", llm_config={"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4"}]})group_chat = GroupChat( agents=[coding_agent, reviewer_agent], messages=[], max_round=5, speaker_selection_method="auto")manager = GroupChatManager(groupchat=group_chat) |
The above snippet illustrates AutoGen’s delegation framework, where agents can dynamically interact, delegate tasks, and collaborate based on their specialized roles and system messages.
## Unique Features of the AutoGen Framework
