# Why Fitting Open Source and AI Together Is So Messy

LONDON — At a panel of leading open source AI experts at the third annual [State of Open Con (SOOCon25)](https://stateofopencon.com/), one thing quickly became clear: Even the pros are having trouble putting together the open source AI puzzle.

Moderator [Alex Williams](https://thenewstack.io/author/alex/), The New Stack’s founder and publisher, opened the conversation by asking [Sam Johnston](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samjohnston/), founder of the [Open Source Alliance (OSA)](https://opensourcealliance.org/#link=%7B), to define the meaning of openness and AI, particularly concerning cost and reproducibility.

“At the heart of [open source AI] is reproducibility,” said Johnston, whose group produced the [Open Weight Definition (OWD)](https://openweight.org/). “You need all of the software and non-software components to be able to reproduce it.”

He continued, “If you want to change the output for a given input, you need to change the data.” This poses unique challenges when training data includes copyrighted material or sensitive personal information that legally cannot be openly shared.

Isn’t that the truth? “We want to just use the [[Open Source Initiative]](https://opensource.org/) definition for traditional software, but we’re stubbing our toe on open source,”said [Luis Vilas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisv/), co-founder and general counsel of the open source security company [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/?utm_content=inline+mention).

“The value of that brand has gotten so big that people need to use that brand even when there’s not really source code in the traditional sense, or at least the source code is a very small part of that value. I think that’s part of what’s confusing everybody right now.”

Indeed, the intersection of open source principles, AI, and data governance is sparking existential questions about how to adapt decades-old frameworks to modern machine learning (ML) systems. For example, Vlas continued, while open source traditionally focused on source code, “The data industry is 15 years behind in their sophistication around openness … we need to bring data experts into these conversations.”

As another example: Everyone knows that AI models risk regurgitating private medical records or copyrighted texts despite safeguards, complicating traditional open licensing models. But there are many more subtle open data issues that few people have even considered, never mind addressed for open source AI uses.

## Sounding Alarms About Corporate Influence
But, while we worry about perfecting the OSI’s [Open Source AI Definition (OSAID)](https://thenewstack.io/the-open-source-ai-definition-is-out/), [Amanda Brock](https://thenewstack.io/author/amanda-brock/), CEO of [OpenUK](https://openuk.uk/) and no fan of the OSIAD, sounded alarms about evolving legislation and corporate influence.

“The [EU’s AI Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai) uses ‘free and open source AI’ without defining it … this lets big companies claim openness while maintaining control through indemnification clauses and insurance barriers,” she said on the panel.

Everyone on the panel warned that without clear standards, only tech giants could shoulder the legal risks of AI deployment — potentially creating a regulatory moat. That’s why, for instance, [Meta](https://about.meta.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) CEO [Mark Zuckerberg is bound and determined to define open source AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-mark-zuckerberg-wants-to-redefine-open-source-so-badly/) his way. If Zuckerberg calls the shots, Meta and the other AI giants will benefit, leaving other, smaller AI companies and organizations in the cold.

With the cost of training state-of-the-art AI models now reaching $500 million, Brock made a stark prediction: “Without true openness, only the U.S. and China will control AI’s future … everyone else gets locked out.”

The path forward appears to require reinventing openness for an era where data supersedes code as the critical component — before corporate and legal forces cement new digital divides.

Of course, if the new [DeepSeek large language model (LLM) ](https://thenewstack.io/icymi-deepseek-is-an-open-source-success-story/)proves to be orders of magnitude cheaper than the LLMs created by Meta, [Google](https://cloud.google.com/?utm_content=inline+mention), [OpenAI](https://thenewstack.io/bill-gates-interviews-sam-altman-about-openais-speedy-rise/) and other tech giants, everything changes. Stay tuned. The [accepted wisdom of AI business models may prove to be foolish](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3811828/the-ai-bust-is-here.html).

Still, the tension between open source preservation and adaptation runs through all these challenges. As Johnston observed, “We risk breaking not just open source AI, but open source itself through conflicting definitions.”

Meanwhile, Villa advocated for flexibility: “We need to unlearn the idea that licenses are always the answer … some components require governance models beyond copyright.”

## What Does ‘Open’ Mean Now?
In short, the traditional concept of openness in software development needs to be redefined for AI systems. The panelists pointed out that simply having open source code is not sufficient for AI; the data used to train the models is equally crucial. This shift requires a new understanding of what constitutes “openness” in the context of AI systems.

The panelists agreed that we need to address the challenge of mixing and merging open source principles, open data and AI technologies to lead to more equitable and innovative developments in the field.

However, careful consideration of legal, ethical, and practical aspects is required to ensure that the benefits of these technologies are widely accessible while also protecting individual rights and preventing the concentration of power in the hands of a few large corporations.

Stay strapped in, folks; we’re in for a bumpy ride.
