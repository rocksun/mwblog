AMSTERDAM – AI is ostensibly a major cause of the severe downturn in employment prospects for computer science majors just coming out of college, as some companies believe that AI can replace junior developers. At the same time, AI-generated code is seen as the catalyst for an explosion in available code and pull requests in open source. This is a sign that we don’t need as many developers as in the past. Others would argue that the code AI generates may work — but very often does not — but overall serves as a poor alternative compared to the work of competent engineers and developers.

While the latter assumption is more accurate, the former paints a picture of what I would argue are some foolhardy false assumptions about the roles and importance of junior developers. This sentiment was echoed by [Jim Zemlin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zemlin/), the Linux Foundation‘s executive director, in his [Open Source Summit Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/) keynote here. He referred to an article in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/technology/coding-ai-jobs-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) highlighting the brutal state of affairs for computer science graduates.

One recent talented graduate interviewed in The New York Times article said that after sending out hundreds of résumés, she was only able to land a job at Chipotle — and that job had nothing to do with writing code. Zemlin also referred to a bold statement [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) CEO [Matt Garman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattgarman/) made in a recent TechRadar article, in which he was quoted as saying that “junior workers could actually be the most important within a company” and more emphatically, said replacing junior developers with AI was the [“dumbest thing I ever heard of.”](https://x.com/techradar/status/1958598990792204387)

Yes, the role of developers and their role in open source and development in general is radically changing, regardless of whether or not there will be a need in the long term for fewer developers. The power of AI and its profound potential should not be ignored.

“Leverage and harness the power of artificial intelligence to make our communities stronger. Let’s have more of that conversation, because I think that’s the conversation that’s really going to matter in five years,” Zemlin said. “Whether or not I’m sitting up here talking to an empty room or I’m sitting up here talking to a lot of hyper productive, open source developers who are creating an ever larger set of innovative, freely available software.”

Meanwhile, there is little reason to believe the VC community’s colossal investments in open source will not continue as AI takes hold. In the “State of Commercial Open Source 2025 Report” released today by the Linux Foundation, [Serena](https://www.serena.vc/) (a European venture capital fund), and the [Commercial Open Source Startup Alliance (COSSA)](https://cossa.io/), the connection between open source community indicators and venture capital activity was highlighted. According to the report, the aggregate funding for commercial open source (COSS) startups totaled $26.4 billion in 2024, and these startups average seven times greater valuations at IPO and 14 times more at mergers and acquisitions, as compared to closed-source peers.

COSS companies consistently outperformed their peers in fundraising velocity, early-stage valuation and liquidity outcomes. For example, the report found that the median IPO valuations for COSS companies were $1.3 billion (vs. $171 million for closed-source peers), and M&A valuations were $482 million (vs. $34 million for closed-source peers). The report demonstrates that open source is not only a viable strategy for startups and investors, it is a “superior one,” particularly for companies building infrastructure software, the report’s authors maintain.

“At Serena and the Linux Foundation, we believe that opposing business and open source is one of the biggest misconceptions in the history of software. But belief is not enough, and so we’ve looked at 25 years of data on VC-backed commercial open source companies, and we’ve looked at the data with two main research questions in mind,” said [Matthieu Lavergne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieulavergne/?originalSubdomain=fr), partner at Serena and co-author of the report, during the keynote.

## AI Challenges

![](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/08/99041206-img_5390.heic)Obviously, there are challenges AI poses to open source projects. In the case of the extremely popular and widely used [cURL](https://thenewstack.io/the-world-runs-20-billion-instances-of-curl-wheres-the-support/) project, [Daniel Stenberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielstenberg/?originalSubdomain=se), who is the founder, lead developer and the single employee of cURL, described struggles AI has posed to maintain the project that millions of users depend on directly and indirectly for their livelihoods.

”I may come off as something negative here, but I just wanted to show you some of the struggles, problems, everyday scenarios that are happening,” Stenberg said. “I’m actually really positive, and I think that open source has come this way, and I think we’re only going to see open source grow stronger and do even more in the future because of everything like this.”

Some might say AI will even require open source to survive in whatever exciting ways that will happen. As [Pallavi Priyadarshini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pallavipr/), engineering head at Amazon OpenSearch Service Dataplane for Amazon Web Services, told me during Open Source Summit Europe:

“The importance of open source is growing because the innovations are so rapid that no one company or no one team can keep up — especially in AI. You also want to have the latest and greatest. So, I think that’s the beauty of how we do the open source way is you come in with your own small set of requirements. The foundational blocks are out of the box. Is that working out where your people are contributing, and they’re saying, ‘You know, they need this for a specific project they’re working on,’ and then they would say they would do this pull request, and it’s helping them at the same time.'”
