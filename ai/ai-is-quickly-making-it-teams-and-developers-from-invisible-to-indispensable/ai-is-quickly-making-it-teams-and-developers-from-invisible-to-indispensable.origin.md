# AI Is Quickly Making IT Teams and Developers From Invisible to Indispensable
A terabyte, which was once considered an unfathomable amount of data, now pales compared to the petabytes that today’s IT teams and their developers manage. Amplified by AI, this data explosion ushers in a new era where the sheer volume of information reshapes industries. Developers stand at the forefront of this transformation, building the systems that make it possible.

This is no longer just about keeping the IT lights on. It’s about leveraging the power of AI, cloud computing, and [data analytics to drive new technological advancements](https://thenewstack.io/empowering-developers-to-harness-sensor-data-for-advanced-analytics/) and effective decision-making. It’s about fortifying the digital world against evolving cyberthreats. And it’s about optimizing user experiences across every industry and use case, in ways unimaginable even a few years ago. The developer of today is virtually unrecognizable from their counterpart just a decade ago — let’s dig into how and why.

## From Support Role to Strategic Influence
The IT landscape has undergone a complete metamorphosis. The industry has come a long way from the “Wild West” of the early days of IT, when developers scavenged code, experimented on the fly, and relied on their own ingenuity to solve problems with limited resources.

But the IT world didn’t stay static for long. It underwent a rapid evolution, driven by the rise of the internet, the explosion of data, and the relentless demand for faster, more reliable, more secure, ubiquitous networks. The focus shifted from building basic LAN [networks to connecting global](https://thenewstack.io/how-meta-is-reinforcing-its-global-network-for-ai-traffic/) enterprises, from managing on-premises servers to harnessing the power of the cloud.

Then came the pandemic, underscoring how indispensable IT [infrastructure had become to every facet of modern](https://thenewstack.io/revolutionizing-storage-the-role-of-gpus-in-modern-infrastructure/) life. Businesses, educational institutions, online retail, critical services like healthcare, and even personal social communications suddenly became reliant on robust, secure networks to function.

This shift revealed the essential nature of IT teams and their developers and the need for an elevated skillset. IT leadership today demands more than technical expertise. This new reality requires aspiring developers to grasp a broader skillset encompassing communication, strategic thinking, and a deep understanding of how innovative technology can drive business value. Those who embrace this evolution will be best positioned to lead their organizations into the data-driven future.

## AI-Native Networking: The Natural Evolution
Take, for example, the unprecedented volume of data generated in industries like healthcare — patient records, medical images, treatment plans, research data — unlike anything previously encountered. Traditional networking models simply aren’t equipped to handle this kind of data explosion or the intense demands for speed, security, real-time analysis, and seamless user experiences that define modern, data-intensive fields. These limitations directly impact users, who are frustrated with slow performance, security vulnerabilities, and a lack of responsiveness.

This is where AI-Native Networking emerges as not just an upgrade, but as the only viable path forward for industries rapidly scaling their [data processing and network](https://thenewstack.io/thwart-ops-sprawl-with-a-unified-data-plane/) demands. AI-driven networks don’t just transmit data — they learn from it. Imagine a network that can anticipate and adapt to network congestion in real-time, ensuring seamless video conferencing for a global team. Or, one that can proactively identify and mitigate potential security threats before they disrupt operations. In a hospital, this could mean creating a network that can identify and isolate the functioning of a compromised infusion pump before it malfunctions, protecting patients from potentially life-threatening errors. This is the potential of AI-native infrastructure — to adapt, anticipate, and optimize performance, no matter the industry, the use case, device, or the volume of data.

## The Human Impact
Amidst the [complexities of code](https://thenewstack.io/navigating-the-complexity-of-legacy-code-with-generative-ai/), networks, and servers, it’s easy to lose sight of the human impact of this work. But it’s crucial to remember that technology is ultimately a tool meant to serve people, and its impact is felt most profoundly in how it improves lives.

The surface of what AI-driven networks can achieve in healthcare has only been scratched. These networks’ robust data processing capabilities enable AI algorithms to analyze vast medical datasets, potentially leading to earlier disease detection, personalized treatment plans, and even the accelerated development of life-saving therapies.

Juniper Networks has seen this firsthand. Through collaborations with established healthcare organizations, Juniper has transformed patient and clinician experiences across sprawling estates of hospitals and facilities by adopting AI-Native Networking. The results speak for themselves: improved patient care, increased staff efficiency, and a more resilient and responsive healthcare ecosystem.

Developers are helping to shape this future — one where technology empowers humans to solve complex problems, optimize efficiency, and ultimately improve the human experience across all industries and walks of life.

## The Road Ahead
The pace of change in IT, especially with the relentless advance of AI, can sometimes feel overwhelming. But instead of fearing it, embracing it is key. Continuous learning, experimentation with new technologies, and a healthy dose of “celebrating failures” are the hallmarks of progress in IT. By building strong networks of peers and mentors, developers can learn from each other, share knowledge, and navigate this exciting, ever-evolving world together.
