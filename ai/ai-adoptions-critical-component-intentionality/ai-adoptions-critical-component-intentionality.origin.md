AI has secured its spot as a game-changer for software development. A recent [GitLab research study](https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey/) found that AI adoption in software development is accelerating remarkably, with 78% of respondents either currently using AI or planning to use it within the next two years.

Organizations that were once hesitant to adopt AI now realize that opting out puts them at a competitive disadvantage. The use of [AI for software development](https://thenewstack.io/is-ai-the-antidote-to-software-development-complexity) is quickly becoming table stakes, even among those who were initially hesitant.

The key is to adopt AI intentionally. Organizational leaders should facilitate conversations between their technical teams, legal teams and AI service providers to build guardrails for AI adoption that minimize risk while maximizing security, productivity, collaboration and efficiency.

## Reducing Toolchain Sprawl
One common challenge in software development is toolchain sprawl. GitLab’s research also shows that two-thirds of DevSecOps professionals want to consolidate their toolchains, citing the toll on developer experience and productivity caused by constantly switching between tools.

The impact of toolchain sprawl goes beyond developer productivity. It adds unnecessary costs, increases complexity, creates information silos and makes it challenging to standardize processes across teams. This can also affect security — more tools mean a larger attack surface and more potential weak points. Think of this as a toolchain tax an organization pays with every piece of software build they generate.

Organizations should evaluate their tools before incorporating AI into complex toolchains. Leaders should identify areas of redundancy, assess opportunities to [streamline processes](https://thenewstack.io/upskilling-engineering-teams-for-the-ai-era) and choose key functions to pilot AI usage. By setting the foundation early on, teams can avoid the challenges of integrating AI into an overcrowded toolkit.

## Rethinking Productivity Metrics
Measuring developer productivity has historically been difficult, and AI is making it more complex. GitLab’s research found that almost all (99%) of C-level tech executives see value in measuring developer productivity, and 57% believe it could help business growth. However, 45% aren’t connecting these measurements to actual business outcomes.

Traditional metrics like lines of code or the number of commits are insufficient when measuring the outcomes of AI implementation, as more lines of code don’t equal high-quality, secure code by default. Modernizing your approach to measurement starts with bringing together quantitative data from across the software development life cycle.

But numbers alone aren’t enough — business leaders must talk to their developers. Understanding how AI is helping (or hindering) their daily work is crucial. This requires looking at the [qualitative metrics of developer experience](https://thenewstack.io/three-key-metrics-to-measure-developer-productivity/) to surface any concerns around career growth and development, psychological safety and peer-to-peer relationships.

Organizations should consider the bigger picture when evaluating AI’s return on investment (ROI) in software development. The metrics that matter are user adoption rates, time to market, revenue impact and customer satisfaction. What’s most relevant will vary between companies, departments and projects. The key is identifying what aligns with your business goals and focusing on those metrics.

## Leveraging AI for Security
Accelerating code creation is often the first outcome business leaders consider when incorporating AI into software development. But there are more use cases for AI than just writing code. Today, security isn’t just the security team’s responsibility — it’s become a shared responsibility with development and operations teams. AI can empower developers to identify and address vulnerabilities on their own. This doesn’t mean security team members are out of the picture — in fact, far from it.

Instead, it paves the way for stronger collaboration between security and development teams.

Given tighter budgets and rising cybersecurity threats, [security professionals](https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security) are under more pressure than ever to keep organizations safe. By strategically [integrating AI into security processes](https://thenewstack.io/prepare-developers-for-integrating-ai-into-their-workflows), organizations can free up security teams to focus on proactive work and not be reactive as code is deployed into production.

For example, AI can be a game-changer in identifying and mitigating potential security threats. By taking on more repetitive tasks, such as analyzing data patterns and user behavior, AI can free up developers to tackle big-picture challenges that require strategic human oversight. It can also automate security testing and analysis, speeding up vulnerability detection and remediation without sacrificing accuracy. By catching and fixing vulnerabilities earlier in the development cycle, organizations can save time and resources as well as build more robust, secure products from the ground up.

## Conclusion
AI is no longer optional in software development, but its transformative potential can only be fully realized through thoughtful, intentional implementation. By staying mindful of key considerations like toolchain overload, productivity measurement and security, organizations can harness the power of AI to drive innovation, enhance productivity and deliver secure software faster.
