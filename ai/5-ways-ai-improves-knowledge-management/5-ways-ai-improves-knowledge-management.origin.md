Given the buzz around it, it’s a little strange you don’t hear much about the possibilities of AI in Knowledge Management.

If you’ve been using large language models like ChatGPT for a while, you know their [strengths](https://thenewstack.io/5-key-learnings-about-ai-and-chatgpt-in-the-enterprise/) and [weaknesses](https://thenewstack.io/the-security-risks-of-generative-ai-package-hallucinations/). They’re excellent at summarizing, can communicate information clearly, and can assist with various tasks.

However — and this is no small detail — they can also occasionally produce blatantly false information. Despite this, LLMs can be [potent tools](https://thenewstack.io/llm-chains-are-transforming-ai-development/) with the proper guidance and oversight.

This combination of strengths makes LLMs [uniquely suited](https://thenewstack.io/why-knowledge-management-doesnt-work/) for tasks like [Knowledge Management](https://invgate.com/guides/knowledge-management/). KM involves capturing, storing, and making accessible the collective knowledge within an organization, ensuring that the correct information is available to the right people at the right time.

Effective KM can enhance a company’s decision-making, streamline operations, and foster innovation by making critical information readily accessible. It can also educate your users about the company and its processes, which is invaluable.

In particular, knowledge bases play a critical role in KM. These centralized repositories store valuable information, from troubleshooting guides and FAQs to best practices and procedural documentation. Knowledge bases ensure that information is not siloed within individual teams or departments but accessible across the organization.

This accessibility is crucial for maintaining consistency, improving efficiency, and enabling continuous learning and development. Suppose organizations can leverage the capabilities of LLMs to enhance their knowledge bases. In that case, they’re immediately relieving tremendous pressure and making things easier for everyone at every step of the way.

**1. Enhancing Content Creation**
AI has become a game-changer in content creation. The idea of AI autonomously generating content might raise some eyebrows — and justifiably so, given its penchant for flights of whimsy. But its true power lies in collaboration.

AI can take care of the initial stages of content creation — drafting outlines, suggesting topics, and keeping the style consistent. This frees up human writers to focus on adding depth, creativity, and nuance to the content, turning raw data into compelling stories.

Just like with most applications of AI in the workplace, the trick is to find the right balance. Let AI handle the repetitive tasks, so human talent can shine where it matters most — ensuring the content is relevant, engaging, and insightful. This partnership not only boosts productivity but also elevates the quality of the content, making it both efficient and impactful.

**2. Summarizing Articles for End-Users**
One of AI’s standout abilities is processing and summarizing vast amounts of text, which is a real boon for Knowledge Management. Put simply: reading takes time, and not everyone is adept at scanning for the precise information they need.

People often need quick access to the main points of extensive documents, and AI-powered summarization tools are perfect for this. They can take lengthy texts and distill them into concise, actionable insights.

AI can ensure critical information is easy to find and understand by creating clear bullet points or executive summaries. This speeds up decision-making and makes it much easier for everyone to access and use the knowledge they need precisely when needed.

**3. Transforming Solved Tickets into Knowledge Articles**
Support tickets are an untapped goldmine of valuable information. Every resolved ticket contains insights that can prevent future issues and streamline processes.

AI can investigate these tickets, extract the essential information, and automatically generate detailed knowledge articles. This preserves the expertise in these tickets and makes them readily accessible for future use, effectively turning a reactive process into a proactive knowledge repository.

However, it’s crucial to handle this with care. Not all information should be public. Sensitive data must be protected, and this is where a strategic approach to tagging and categorizing comes into play. By ensuring that articles are appropriately classified, we can maintain confidentiality and ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information. This careful management ensures that our knowledge base is secure and rich in information.

**4. Intelligent Categorization and Tagging of Knowledge**
To truly unlock the potential of AI in Knowledge Management, ensure the knowledge base is meticulously organized. AI can excel at categorizing and tagging knowledge articles, making information easily searchable and accessible. Think of it as a virtual librarian who knows where information is stored and can retrieve it instantly.

The beauty of AI lies in its ability to identify key themes and assign relevant tags, enhancing the discoverability of knowledge. But it’s not just about making information easy to find. A well-structured tagging and categorization strategy is essential for managing access levels and maintaining confidentiality. Sensitive information must be securely stored and accessible only to those who need it. This approach maintains the integrity and utility of the knowledge base while fostering a secure and efficient Knowledge Management environment.

**5. Automating Documentation of Resolution Steps**
This may be a ways away, but given the speed at which AI and related technologies are advancing, it’s hard not to think about how their use can further boost knowledge management.

In IT support and troubleshooting, AI could theoretically record the sequences of actions taken to resolve issues, generate detailed scripts, and create comprehensive knowledge articles. This automation captures intricate processes and transforms them into accessible knowledge assets.

Imagine AI learning from user interactions, recording every step to understand task performance. This would be groundbreaking. We could document complex processes automatically, enriching our knowledge base with precise, actionable insights.

This approach raises privacy considerations, but that’s a debate for another day. By automating the documentation process, we could ensure that valuable knowledge is preserved and easily accessible, empowering our teams to work more efficiently and effectively.

**In summary LLMs and knowledge bases are a natural pair designed to present information.**
From content creation and summarization to transforming support tickets and integrating chatbots, the impact of AI is profound and far-reaching. Implementing AI strategies thoughtfully, with human oversight and robust categorization, ensures the quality and confidentiality of knowledge. This careful approach — which we have adopted for our [InvGate AI Hub](https://invgate.com/ai-hub/) — allows us to harness AI’s capabilities while maintaining control over sensitive information.

As AI continues to evolve, its applications in KM will expand, offering unparalleled opportunities to enhance how organizations manage and utilize their knowledge assets. Embracing these advancements will streamline operations and elevate organizational Knowledge Management to new heights, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.

This process is a paradigm shift regarding information. The organizations that adapt and evolve these technologies will lead the charge into a new era of efficiency, intelligence, and excellence.
