**TLDR: When building a remote MCP server, you will most likely need an OIDC
layer between clients (Claude, Cursor etc) and your upstream IdP (Auth0, Clerk
etc). We have created a ready to use solution for you that's vendor neutral: use
any IdP you want.**

MCP servers need real authentication and authorization. Tokens must be issued,
refreshed, validated, and tied to upstream identity. Clients need to log in,
obtain credentials, and call your MCP server securely. It's complicated,
especially if you aren't a security engineer. You shouldn't roll your own auth,
but if the existing tools don't work out of the box, what do you do?

Implementing a
[remote hosted MCP server](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11503834-building-custom-connectors-via-remote-mcp-servers)
requires implementing
[MCP Authorization Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization)
which is based on OAuth 2.1 (DRAFT). In theory, this is straightforward because
modern applications either implement OAuth specs themselves or use an
OAuth-compliant IdP like Auth0 or Clerk. That's what I thought at least, but ran
into major issues the moment I started implementing.

That's why we built and open-sourced the
[mcp-oidc-provider](https://github.com/tigrisdata/mcp-oidc-provider): a minimal,
production-ready OIDC provider designed specifically for MCP workflows.

## MCP Protocol Requires Discovery (OAuth or OIDC)[​](#mcp-protocol-requires-discovery-oauth-or-oidc "Direct link to MCP Protocol Requires Discovery (OAuth or OIDC)")

The MCP Specification
([2025-11-25](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#protected-resource-metadata-discovery-requirements))
explicitly requires OAuth. Per the spec:

* A protected MCP server acts as an OAuth 2.1 resource server, capable of
  accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.
* An MCP client acts as an OAuth 2.1 client, making protected resource requests
  on behalf of a resource owner.

And for Discovery, MCP authorization servers (which is what this package is used
for) MUST provide at least one of the discovery mechanisms:

* OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata
  ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414))
* OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0

OpenID Connect Discovery (OIDC) is technically optional, but you'll need some
identity layer to fully secure your MCP server. OAuth provides a way for the
client to ask your MCP authorization server to go and get authorization from the
resource owner. It doesn't verify the identity of the client. OIDC handles the
identity part for you.

Without OIDC, you have to build custom integrations per provider to verify
identity. You'll need to implement your own token refresh logic including
`offline_access` support. Redirect URIs like `mcp://cursor/auth` or
`claude://oauth/callback` will get rejected by standard IdPs, since they are not
web URLs and require explicit OIDC support. And your MCP server wouldn't work
with desktop clients like Claude and Cursor.

Just use OIDC. It's way easier.

### You need both OAuth and OIDC[​](#you-need-both-oauth-and-oidc "Direct link to You need both OAuth and OIDC")

In this package, I have implemented both the OAuth and OIDC discovery endpoints,
the reason? MCP clients MUST support trying both discovery mechanisms, but not
all the clients conform to the specification. So for example, if they only
implemented OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 for discovery, `mcp-oidc-provider` will
still work.

Our well known
[OIDC endpoint](https://mcp.storage.dev/.well-known/openid-configuration) is
out-of-the-box from OpenID. For maximum compatibility, we implement the OAuth
endpoints:

## Dynamic Client Registration: Upstream IdPs alone don't solve this[​](#dynamic-client-registration-upstream-idps-alone-dont-solve-this "Direct link to Dynamic Client Registration: Upstream IdPs alone don't solve this")

Per the MCP Specification: "Authorization servers and MCP clients **SHOULD**
support the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol
([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591))." On its face, it
seems like this should make IdPs that support dynamic client registration work
for most MCP clients.

When using Auth0 for the first iteration, we enabled dynamic client
registration. It technically worked for authorizing MCP clients without any
middleware, but each ephemeral client showed up in the list of long-lived third
party apps. So for each user, we had a third party app for each session. As you
can imagine, our fingers hurt from clicking through that list. And issuing
scoped access tokens per client was a pain.

![A bunch of dynamically created OAuth clients drowning out the statically defined ones](/blog/assets/images/oauth-clients-1f309154bab0cc028818e1d876ddb0e7.webp)

We needed one third party app in the list, a small OIDC provider, that could
control access for all the MCP clients. Lest our eyes bleed from the dashboard
bloat.

## Introducing mcp-oidc-provider[​](#introducing-mcp-oidc-provider "Direct link to Introducing mcp-oidc-provider")

A minimal, opinionated OIDC provider built specifically for MCP servers that you
can use with any OIDC compatible IdP.

Using this, you get exactly what the specification requires:

* A protected MCP server acts as an OAuth 2.1 resource server, capable of
  accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.
* A client that acts as an OAuth 2.1 client, making protected resource requests
  on behalf of a resource owner.

Additionally, we store sessions, tokens, grants, and OIDC adapter data in a key
value store. You can use Tigris as your KV store like we did, or any other store
that is supported by [Keyv](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/), like Redis or
Postgres.

### Usage: Referencing the Standalone Implementation[​](#usage-referencing-the-standalone-implementation "Direct link to Usage: Referencing the Standalone Implementation")

The best place to start is the
[standalone OIDC provider](https://github.com/tigrisdata/mcp-oidc-provider/tree/main/example/standalone-oidc).
Use it if you already have your MCP implementation in a different stack than
Express, or if you want to run Auth as a standalone microservice you can scale
independently. You can have your MCP server use NextJS or another framework,
then you can run this server standalone and proxy the Auth requests to this
server.

The standalone provider has:

* bootstrap server code
* provider configuration
* upstream IdP wiring
* routing setup
* storage adapter example
* complete OIDC endpoint registration

And, optionally, you can use Tigris as your key-value store.

Once you have the repo cloned and your dependencies installed with
`npm install`, setup your environment:

```
cat .env  
# configure your upstream IdP  
UPSTREAM_ISSUER=https://YOUR_DOMAIN.auth0.com  
UPSTREAM_CLIENT_ID=...  
UPSTREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=...  
UPSTREAM_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback  
  
#configure your own provider issuer  
OIDC_ISSUER=http://localhost:4000  
OIDC_PORT=4000  
  
# Tigris (for @tigrisdata/keyv-tigris)  
TIGRIS_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=tid_xxxxx  
TIGRIS_STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=tsec_yyyyy  
TIGRIS_STORAGE_BUCKET=my-kv-bucket  

```

MCP clients will fetch
`[http://localhost:4000/.well-known/openid-configuration](http://localhost:4000/.well-known/openid-configuration)`
to discover which endpoints they need for the OAuth flow.

You run the provider with `npm start`. You can run it alongside your MCP server,
and the Auth requests will proxy to it.

Point your clients to your OIDC issuer. For example, Claude Desktop expects:

```
{  
  "auth": {  
    "issuer": "http://localhost:4000"  
  }  
}  

```

And when you get a request to your MCP server, you verify the tokens using JWKS:

```
import { createRemoteJWKSet, jwtVerify } from "jose";  
  
const jwks = createRemoteJWKSet(new URL("http://localhost:4000/jwks"));  
  
const { payload } = await jwtVerify(accessToken, jwks);  
  
console.log("User:", payload.sub);  

```

That's it. You have a fully functioning OIDC-based MCP auth flow.

### Usage: Integrated Mode (Express + MCP)[​](#usage-integrated-mode-express--mcp "Direct link to Usage: Integrated Mode (Express + MCP)")

This is the easiest way to get started if you're using Node / Express for your
MCP server. In integrated mode, you run one Express app that:

* Hosts the OIDC provider (/.well-known/openid-configuration, /authorize,
  /token, /jwks, /register)
* Hosts your MCP endpoint
* Handles all OAuth + OIDC flows end-to-end
* Exposes a single BASE\_URL you point your MCP client at

First, install your dependencies:

```
npm install mcp-oidc-provider keyv openid-client express  

```

You'll also want `typescript`, `ts-node`, etc. if you're using TS, but that's
standard.

Second, generate your JWKS signing keys once. You'll save them in your `.env.`

```
npx mcp-oidc-provider --pretty  

```

Copy the printed JSON and store it in a secure location (e.g. secret manager),
then inject it via the JWKS environment variable.

For dev, you can skip this (keys are auto-generated, but tokens break on
restart, after the token cache expires).

Third, configure your environment:

```
cat .env  
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000          # Where this combined server runs  
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-idp-client-id  
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-idp-client-secret  
SESSION_SECRET=some-long-random-string  
JWKS=...                                # JSON from `npx mcp-oidc-provider --pretty` (prod only)  

```

BASE\_URL must be the public URL clients will use for:

* OIDC discovery (/.well-known/openid-configuration)
* OAuth callback (/oauth/callback)
* MCP endpoint (whatever route you choose under this server)

Now you can add the OIDC provider to your sever by using the function
`setupMcpExpress()`. It will:

* Mount the OIDC provider routes onto the Express app
* Wire up MCP auth (bearer auth + token verification)
* Return:
  + app: the configured Express instance
  + `handleMcpRequest(handler)`: a helper to register your MCP request handler
    with auth + user already resolved

Here's an example of how to use it:

```
import express from "express";  
import { Keyv } from "keyv";  
import { setupMcpExpress } from "mcp-oidc-provider/mcp";  
import { OidcClient } from "mcp-oidc-provider/oidc";  
import type { JWKS } from "mcp-oidc-provider";  
  
async function main() {  
    
  const jwks: JWKS | undefined = process.env.JWKS  
    ? JSON.parse(process.env.JWKS)  
    : undefined;  
  
  if (!process.env.BASE_URL) {  
    throw new Error("BASE_URL is required");  
  }  
  if (!process.env.OIDC_CLIENT_ID || !process.env.OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET) {  
    throw new Error("OIDC_CLIENT_ID and OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET are required");  
  }  
  if (!process.env.SESSION_SECRET) {  
    throw new Error("SESSION_SECRET is required");  
  }  
  
    
  const idpClient = new OidcClient({  
    issuer: "https://your-tenant.auth0.com",   
    clientId: process.env.OIDC_CLIENT_ID,  
    clientSecret: process.env.OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET,  
    redirectUri: `${process.env.BASE_URL}/oauth/callback`,  
      
  });  
  
    
  const store = new Keyv();   
  
    
    
    
    
  const { app, handleMcpRequest } = setupMcpExpress({  
    idpClient,  
    store,  
    baseUrl: process.env.BASE_URL,  
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,  
    jwks,  
  });  
  
    
    
  handleMcpRequest(async (req, res) => {  
    console.log("Authenticated user:", req.user);  
  
      
      
      
  
      
    res.json({  
      jsonrpc: "2.0",  
      id: req.body?.id ?? null,  
      result: {  
        message: "Hello from integrated MCP + OIDC server!",  
        user: req.user,  
      },  
    });  
  });  
  
  const port = Number(process.env.PORT ?? 3000);  
  app.listen(port, () => {  
    console.log(`MCP + OIDC server listening on ${port}`);  
    console.log(`Base URL: ${process.env.BASE_URL}`);  
  });  
}  
  
main().catch((err) => {  
  console.error(err);  
  process.exit(1);  
});  

```

Finally, you can point your clients to your MCP server. For example, Claude
Desktop expects:

```
{  
  "auth": {  
    "issuer": "http://localhost:4000"  
  }  
}  

```

The actual config shape depends on the client, but the pattern is:

* Issuer = BASE\_URL of this server
* MCP endpoint = whatever MCP route your integrated server exposes (the one
  wired by handleMcpRequest)

Once configured:

* The client hits `/.well-known/openid-configuration` on your server.
* It performs `/.authorize` → `/token` flows against your server.
* Your server federates login to upstream IdP via OidcClient.
* Your server issues MCP-specific tokens and validates them for /mcp requests.
* Your handler gets authenticated requests with req.user populated.

That's it. Your server is now an integrated OIDC issuer, token endpoint, and MCP
endpoint.

## Using the mcp-oidc-provider in production[​](#using-the-mcp-oidc-provider-in-production "Direct link to Using the mcp-oidc-provider in production")

We use it for our hosted MCP server, and we trust it enough to offer it to you.
It uses standard libraries for authentication and authorization. And, it doesn't
lock you into any vendor.

We've made mcp-oidc-provider as generic as possible, including adding additional
configurations to enhance what your IdP offers. For example, we allow you to
configure your JWKS caching settings just in case your IdP doesn't provide
`Cache-Control: max-age` headers. This can be helpful if your company has
security requirements around key rotation events that require expiring keys
after a certain period of time.

If you're using `jose.createRemoteJWKSet`, the way you typically control
expiration is by passing options when creating the JWKS fetcher:

```
import { createRemoteJWKSet } from "jose";  
  
const jwksUri = new URL("https://your-issuer/.well-known/jwks.json");  
  
const jwks = createRemoteJWKSet(jwksUri, {  
    
  cooldownDuration: 30_000,  
    
  cacheMaxAge: 600_000,  
});  

```

mcp-oidc-provider fit into your MCP server.
