Glitch, the platform that allows developers to build “full-stack web apps in your browser,” announced today that it is adding more “open web” features to Glitch, to encourage more discovery and curation on the platform. I spoke to Glitch’s CEO
[Anil Dash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anildash/) to find out more. Dash is also VP of developer experience at Fastly, which [acquired Glitch](https://thenewstack.io/glitch-fastly-developer-experience/) back in May 2022.
“So we have a really big update coming,” said Dash, “which is being able to add any site that you create on the open web to Glitch, whether you made it with Glitch or not — and so that can be on your profile, that can be featured in playlists, and all the other things that we do.”
In addition to the new open web features on
[Glitch](https://glitch.com/), Fastly is today launching an [AI Accelerator](http://fastly.com/ai), which it says will “help developers accelerate performance and reduce costs” for AI applications. “Fastly AI Accelerator is designed to reduce API calls and costs with intelligent, semantic caching,” said the company in a press release.
All of these new features will be explained in more detail at a
[live-streamed event](https://www.fastly.com/instant) being run by Fastly later today.
## Why Glitch is Doubling Down on Open Web
The new AI features are to be expected — tech companies risk getting left behind if they don’t announce
*something* new with AI in 2024. But it’s rarer to find a company doubling down on the open web. Although Dash himself is a vocal proponent of web technologies — at the end of last year, he even managed to get an article [published in Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/) extolling the virtues of the open web.
“Talking to developers, people are very excited about the sort of research into the open web that’s happening right now,” Dash told me. “Especially for us, we’re seeing lots of people building fediverse bots and Mastodon bots and things like that. [But] there’s not a lot of discovery. The way that the community articulates it, Google is kind of broken.”
That led the Glitch team to reconsider how they would “do discovery, sharing and exploration of the open web.”
The result of those internal discussions is a new version of Glitch.com, which will launch later today. The most obvious change is the ability to add
**any new site** to the platform. So, for example, I will be able to add my hobby project, an [internet history website](https://cybercultural.com/) built with Eleventy, to Glitch. I will then be able to tap into all of Glitch’s features and promote my site to the developer-focused Glitch community.
Fastly shared the following screenshots with me, to illustrate the changes.
According to Dash, eventually, you’ll be able to do things like sharing and commenting on Glitch. The goal is to enable users to “find personal websites, human-made websites, that kind of open web content,” he said.
Essentially, Glitch wants to turn apps or sites into social objects that can be more easily shared and spread around the internet. “On Instagram, the social object is the photo. The social object on Glitch is the site or the app,” said Dash.
Glitch hopes that by making sites and apps into social objects, curation will become a bigger part of its user experience. Referencing my own internet history website, Dash mentioned that he’d like to create “a playlist of tech history websites” which would include my site along with other similar sites, like
[Folklore.org](http://folklore.org).
## Layering Developer Features On Top
Even better is the potential for “layering on developer features on top of that discovery,” as Dash put it.
“Access to millions of independent applications [for developers], and millions of independent websites, is a really, really interesting idea,” said Dash. “So that’s sort of the next big piece there.”
As examples of functionality that developers might find useful, Dash mentioned the ability to show you all the apps with a certain tag, or those that have an RSS feed to crawl.
As for website operators, heaven knows they need all the help they can get with discovery. With the advent of
[AI overviews from Google](https://thenewstack.io/devs-get-ai-pixie-dust-at-google-i-o-but-no-search-updates/) and other search engines, the open web is facing an [existential crisis](https://thenewstack.io/as-search-engines-become-ai-chatbots-what-can-publishers-do/). So it’s great to hear that Glitch is keen to help provide solutions. Especially since Glitch is a beloved platform among many web developers.
Developers commonly use Glitch to prototype new apps, or simply play around with the latest web technologies. Want to experiment with React, or mess around on Node, or blog with Eleventy, or check out the hype around SQLite? You can do that all on Glitch. Adding discovery and curation to the platform helps developers even more, and may also attract a new crowd — the type of early adopter or tech-curious user that regularly visits the likes of Reddit or Product Hunt, for instance.
## What About the Fediverse?
I asked if Glitch is planning on joining
[the fediverse](https://thenewstack.io/the-creator-of-activitypub-on-whats-next-for-the-fediverse/), the network of sites and apps using the ActivityPub specification from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Fastly already [supports some notable fediverse projects](https://thenewstack.io/anil-dash-on-mastodon-joining-fastlys-open-source-program/), including Mastodon, so it would make sense. But Dash is more circumspect about this.
“We don’t have an announcement there,” he said, “but we’re listening to the community. I would be shocked if they don’t have that [fediverse] towards the top of their list of what they’re looking for. We’d love to see that.”
Dash noted that the curation aspect of the new Glitch could easily be connected to the fediverse, similar to what
[Flipboard enabled](https://about.flipboard.com/inside-flipboard/flipboard-begins-to-federate/) at the end of last year for its community (currently in private beta).
“For example, being able to follow someone’s curation of interesting personal websites as an account that I can follow on Mastodon… incredible! I think that’s as interesting to me as YouTube is for video. And so that’s sort of where we want to go.”
