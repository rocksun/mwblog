*By Olivia Hadjiioannou & Team Oh.*

*I Pray for Love* is a short musical film that explores themes of spiritual introspection and self-awareness. I composed and performed the music, and the visuals were created entirely through the generative AI model “Sora,” developed by OpenAI.

We gave Sora a set of static images of myself from different perspectives. Over 300+ detailed text-based prompts were iteratively refined over and over to guide the generative output. Sora produced a character animation, dynamic environmental transitions, intricate lighting, and the symbolic imagery we were looking for. 

What was really remarkable was that **Sora’s output accurately replicated my movements, facial expressions, and physical attributes, hair dynamics, and posture just from a photograph**, without specific prompting. This went way beyond our initial expectations.

> “The greatest discovery was that you actually need to be an intelligent writer to effectively use AI! It really got down to the point of how to describe a feeling and a moment in a short sentence: descriptive enough, but not too abstract or too pragmatic. It was very important to also know exactly how to ask for camera shots. It was a dance of poetic imagination and technical precision.”

The visual creation process took approximately 80+ hours of collaborative human-AI work, and resulted in this visually compelling short film.

## **Tech**

**Concept & Creative Direction**

Each line of the lyrics from the track was interpreted visually. The overall tone was mystical, cosmic, and emotional. The goal wasn’t to illustrate the song literally but the emotional journey of a prayer and reflect its spiritual tension and transformational energy.

We focused on themes like:

* Longing vs. Presence
* Spiritual emergence
* The illusion of separation
* Symbolic reunion

**AI Tool: OpenAI Sora**

Initially, we tested Sora using the Plus version, generating clips at 720p. When we saw promising results from our prompts and the symbolic scenes had strong motion fidelity, we upgraded to the Pro version to access full 1080p output. Once on Pro, we began using Sora’s storyboard mode to build longer, more thematically cohesive segments.

**Resolution:** Generated at 720p (Plus), then at 1080p (Pro); some clips were further upscaled using Topaz Video AI.

**1. Camera Lenses and Focal Lengths**

* **35 mm lens**:  
    *Used for sweeping landscapes, crane shots, orbiting drones, and wide cinematic framing.*
* **50 mm lens**:  
    *Often for intimate cinematic portraits*
* **85 mm macro lens**:  
    *Close-up shots, capturing detailed textures and subtle emotional nuances.*
* **24 mm lens**:  
    *Wide-angle for expansive cosmic and surreal scenes.*

**2. Drone & Aerial Movements**

* **360° drone orbit** *Encircling to give an epic, immersive perspective.*
* **Ascending spiral drone shot** *Rising smoothly while circling symbolic of transcendence.*
* **Descending drone crane shot** *Epic downward approach, capturing grand scale.*
* **Sweeping drone crane arcs** *Expansive, smooth curved movements for majestic reveal.*
* **Vertical drone push-in** *Rising dramatically toward or descending toward a focal point.*
* **Majestic aerial tracking** *Horizontal movements, following across grand landscapes.*

3. Crane and Dolly Movements

* **Slow-motion dolly-in** *Emotional intimacy, dramatic intensity.*
* **Slow crane-in** *Gently moving inward for spiritual, meditative moments.*
* **Sweeping crane rotation** *Elegant, graceful movements highlighting mystical or transcendent elements.*
* **Crane push-forward** *Dynamic, forward-moving shots adding dramatic tension*
* **Ascending crane movements** *Uplifting, elevating visual energy for scenes of spiritual awakening.*

**4. Steadicam & Handheld Movements**

* **Fluid Steadicam glide** *Smooth, organic motion, capturing flowing dance or spiritual movements.*
* **Intimate handheld tracking** *Raw emotional intensity, closeness.*
* **Slow-motion handheld arcs** *Heightened, poetic realism and emotional immediacy.*

**5. Special Cinematic Techniques**

* **Slow-motion** *Dreamy, emotional scenes, often poetic or metaphysical.*
* **Hyper-dynamic tracking** *Rapid, exhilarating movements emphasizing cosmic or epic journeys.*
* **Macro-to-wide pull-out** *Revealing vast scale dramatically from intimate detail.*
* **Dynamic circular tracking** *Capturing symbolic movements (like ritual dance), emphasizing cyclical themes.*

**Style references:**

* Epic emotional movements and dynamic narrative framing
* Graceful, whimsical, organic camera flow
* Expansive, cosmic, thoughtful camera moves
* Slow poetic realism, spiritually meditative scenes
* Intimate realism, dramatic symbolic movements
* Grand scale and operatic cinematic movements
* Cinematic clarity, epic scale, thoughtful framing
* Fantastical and mystical camera moves
* Surreal, symbolic, ritualistic framing
* Blockbuster spectacle and epic emotional grandeur

**Clip length:** 5-10 second scenes (Even though we had Pro there was no option for more)

**Prompt Design Example**

Scene: Olivia (girl in photo) kneels in an infinite field of white roses, wind sweeping petals upward. Light pulses from her chest in sync with unseen strings. Style: Sacred, surrealist realism Camera: Slow dolly-in, 35mm lens, ethereal glow

We crafted over 380 unique prompts, iterating on imagery for emotional resonance. A single still image of Olivia on the album cover was used most often to anchor continuity across the output.

**Editing & Post Production**

* Clips were assembled in **iMovie**
* Music layered after visual sequence was complete
* Resolution enhanced using Topaz Video AI
* Final duration: 3 minutes, 45 seconds

**Challenges**

* Prompt misinterpretation (especially for abstract spiritual symbolism)
* Fingers and limbs
* Repetition of imagery
* Natural continuity between scenes

OpenAI’s Sora provided a very powerful and creative pipeline for quickly generating imaginative, cinematic video content. 

For better workflow and output quality in future projects we might need to:

* Refine prompt details for consistency
* Use Storyboards more
* Generate at 1080p from the beginning

This creative tool significantly reduced the resources needed for our video/film and expanded the creative possibilities available to us.

> “This AI tool became something like a creative partner for me. It was almost like having a conversation with my subconscious and the visuals organically revealed themselves. The more I tried to control every tiny detail, movement, or prompt, the more there was a risk of losing that magic and creativity found in the beautiful imperfections.”
