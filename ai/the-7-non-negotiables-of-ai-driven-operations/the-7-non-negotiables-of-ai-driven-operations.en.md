The pressure to deliver seamless, always-on digital experiences has never been higher, but digital operations teams and budgets often can’t keep up with this reality. As digital operations grow more complex and incidents require resolution in minutes, not hours, it’s becoming clearer than ever why organizations need AI and automation to support today’s real-world operations.

These technologies now form the backbone of modern AI-driven operations and incident response, cutting mean time to repair (MTTR), reducing downtime and strengthening resilience. [IDC](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52691924#:~:text=Notably%2C%20IDC%20reports%2067%25%20of,cloud%20and%20digital%20service%20providers.) predicts that by the end of 2025, 67% of enterprise AI investment will come from embedding AI in core operations. Yet spending alone is not enough. Companies must ensure that AI and automation deliver [measurable return on investment and operational value](https://thenewstack.io/want-to-mitigate-risk-invest-in-automation/) to ensure deployments are for impact, not appearance.

## **The 7 Non-Negotiables of AI and Automation Scorecard**

To assess the true value of AI and automation investments, organizations must work to deliver against these seven non-negotiables of AI-driven operations:

## **1. True End-to-End Incident Management**

When incidents strike, teams can’t afford to jump between disconnected tools or lose context. Siloed systems cause delays, confusion and added cost. Having different ticketing systems, ChatOps tools, processes and practices in place across business functions makes incident management messy.

Organizations need a unified AI and automation layer that supports the full [incident life cycle](https://thenewstack.io/best-practices-for-mastering-the-incident-life-cycle/), from detection through continuous learning and prevention. This layer eliminates the need for piecemeal integrations, where AI or automation only address part of the chain or require heavy integration to work effectively.

## **2. Built-In Automation**

Automation should be embedded, not bolted on. Implementations that require constant human intervention or only handle single steps add complexity, not efficiency. Automation should work harmoniously with existing workflows rather than against them.

Native automation orchestrates across teams, tools and time zones, democratizing automation [so everyone has secure access to workflows](https://thenewstack.io/chaos-to-control-3-steps-for-automating-incident-management/). The right controls are also important to ensure investments can scale safely across the enterprise. The airline [Ryanair](https://www.pagerduty.com/customer/ryanair/), for example, automates over 25,000 daily tasks within its incident management life cycle, saving more than 1,000 human hours a year through embedded auto-remediation for known incidents.

## **3. Operational-Grade AI**

For effective incident management, AI must understand IT operations, not just analyze data. The technology should detect patterns, make real-time decisions and trigger alerts with precision. It should act as a digital twin for IT infrastructure, taking the pressure off human responders, enabling them to focus on higher-value tasks.

To get to this point, AI must be trained on real [operational data with guardrails in place to ensure reliability](https://thenewstack.io/why-launch-time-reliability-is-especially-critical/) and integration. Flashy AI without context fails under pressure; operational-grade AI delivers usable insights every time.

## **4. Actionable Post-Incident Reviews**

Incidents should drive learning, not just fixes. If [post-incident reviews](https://thenewstack.io/3-strategies-to-turn-incidents-into-learning-opportunities/) aren’t providing actionable insights, then businesses are doomed to repeat the same mistakes. Manual reporting processes and disconnected documents slow progress and should be avoided. Reviews must be tied to action and outcomes.

Organizations need AI-powered reviews that include generative AI-driven narrative capabilities. These AI-driven reviews transform incidents into actionable discussions and meaningful lessons for next time. For example, [Zendesk](https://www.pagerduty.com/customer/zendesk/) automated post-incident reviews, cutting analysis time by 80% and increasing attendance and engagement at post-incident analysis.

## **5. A Connected Ecosystem**

The best [incident management platforms don’t require IT teams](https://thenewstack.io/what-can-incident-teams-learn-from-crisis-management/) to change the way they work but will meet them exactly where they are. Organizations need AI and automation that enable agility and reduce friction. After all, if tools force you to adapt to them, then they don’t help your digital operations teams; they hold them back. Teams require AI and automation initiatives that integrate seamlessly with applications already in use, whether for observability, ticketing or collaboration.

## **6. Ease of Use**

If AI or automation is hard to use, then it won’t add value to incident management workflows. Incident response demands value from day one, not several months or years down the line. Ease of use means AI and automation that doesn’t come with heavy lift implementations, rigid setups, and constant reworks just to keep pace. Consider [Specsavers](https://www.pagerduty.com/customer/specsavers/): In less than a year, it scaled automation to more than 120,000 executions across 2,000 stores, saving 225 days of manual work and reducing service analyst onboarding time by 75%.

## **7. Proven Reliability**

When a SEV 1 or SEV 2 incident occurs, response teams need AI and automation that won’t add to the chaos. Reliability is non-negotiable. IT operations demand AI and automation with high availability and zero unplanned downtime. Nothing undermines incident response faster than surprise outages, maintenance downtime or spotty uptime during critical business hours. Businesses must have AI and automation that have a proven track record of performing under pressure.

## **Building Resilience at Scale**

To [build resilient operations](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-build-resilient-it-operations-in-4-steps/) at scale, enterprises must stress test AI and automation tools against these seven principles. Deployments that take months to show value, lack reliability guarantees or carry a high total cost of ownership signal fragility and should be avoided. The same applies to any implementations with single [points of failure](https://thenewstack.io/addressing-3-failure-points-of-multiregion-incident-response/) (such as chat app dependencies) with no redundancy or those that require multiple add-ons to function. By choosing technologies that perform under pressure, organizations can standardize AI and automation, make faster and smarter decisions, and turn incident management into a competitive advantage.
