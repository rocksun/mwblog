The age of “vibe coding” is here, and it’s already breaking things in production. What began as playful experimentation with AI-assisted development has crept into critical workflows. In a hackathon, [vibing your way through feature development](https://thenewstack.io/power-apps-plans-feature-vibe-ifies-business-app-dev/) is fine. However, once you’re pushing to production, prototyping your way through a sprint can invite regressions, brittle logic, and security gaps.

It’s easy to be seduced by speed: Drop in a prompt, get runnable code, and ship. However, when correctness, maintainability, and scalability are at stake, that approach breaks down. Teams are [left cleaning up after code](https://thenewstack.io/a-developers-lifecycle-how-i-shifted-my-thinking-and-coding-left/) that looked fine but failed under pressure. What felt like momentum quickly became expensive technical debt.

We need to draw a line: Writing code that runs isn’t the same as engineering software that lasts. Anyone can get a prompt to output code that compiles. Building something durable requires architecture, testing, and intentionality, which is more than just going with the vibes.

## Vibe Coding Just Feels Good — Until It Doesn’t

Vibe coding thrives in the early phase of any project. There’s no existing code to integrate with, no test suite to break, no edge cases to worry about. Just you, a few prompts, and output that looks good enough to demo.

And it works — until it doesn’t.

A developer spins up a new feature. It compiles. It works on the happy path. So it ships. However, a week later, a bug report arrives: Users are accessing admin-only functionality. The generated logic failed to include an authorization check. No tests were written to catch it. No one reviewed the code closely because it appeared to be fine.

As the team investigates, more cracks appear. Naming is inconsistent. Business logic is tangled with UI glue code. Reusable components were rewritten from scratch. One patch breaks another. Confidence in the feature drops, and trust in the AI workflow erodes.

This isn’t rare — it’s the predictable result of prioritizing speed without structure.

## A Shift Left To Vibe Engineering

The solution isn’t to reject AI. It’s to evolve how we use it.

Vibe engineering retains the generative power of AI but embeds it within structure, intent, and constraint. Developers take on a new role: they define behavior, specify constraints, and orchestrate specialized agents — not just to generate code, but to engineer software.

Instead of prompting [“write a billing function,” developers guide](https://thenewstack.io/a-software-developers-guide-to-technical-writing/) the AI: “Extend the existing processInvoice() logic to support usage-based tiers. Use formatCurrency() from utils. Apply the same access checks used in subscriptions.ts.”

Now the AI isn’t freelancing. It’s operating within boundaries, with context and accountability.

Vibe [engineering means agents](https://thenewstack.io/ai-alignment-in-practice-what-it-means-and-how-to-get-it/) that parse your repo, understand your architecture, and reuse components intelligently. Code doesn’t just work — it fits. Tests are wrapped in from the start. Secure defaults are assumed. Patterns are respected.

The result? Code you can drop into a PR, reason about, and extend. Software that evolves cleanly. And a [development process that scales](https://thenewstack.io/infrastructure-as-code-increase-security-scale-development/) without breaking.

This is the core of vibe engineering: moving from improvisation to orchestration. You’re not writing every line — you’re designing the system that writes it, checks it, and future-proofs it.

## The Developer’s Changing Role: From Author to Orchestrator

To succeed in this new orchestration role, here are four critical practices you should adopt:

1. **Think Beyond the Task — Think About the System**Don’t just solve a ticket. Ask what part of the system needs to evolve to support this change cleanly and durably. Should you create a new abstraction, upgrade a shared utility, or refactor a core service? Think systemically — not just locally.
2. **Codify the Rules You Want AI to Follow**Before generating code, define the architectural standards, style conventions, and workflow expectations that your AI assistant must follow. These might include naming rules, preferred directory structures, abstraction boundaries, or protected areas of the repo. Some tools infer these rules automatically, while others rely on explicit guidance. However, in every case, you should make these expectations clear so that the AI writes like a team member.
   * Document rules your codebase follows and turn them into constraints the AI can work with, either as rules or in documents that you continuously reference for in every task.
3. **Direct the AI Toward Reuse — and Proactive Improvement**Guide the AI toward the current and clean parts of your codebase, excluding legacy or deprecated code. Explicitly reference reusable components, utility functions, and services that are meant to be extended. The goal is to grow the codebase from its strongest foundations and maintain DRY principles. While some platforms can detect these reuse opportunities automatically, others require developer-curated context. Either way, your direction determines whether the agent strengthens or erodes the system.

And don’t stop at reuse — encourage the agent to evaluate and improve what it touches. If it identifies duplication, tight coupling, or outdated logic in reused components, it should flag and upgrade them accordingly. Since generative AI enables rapid implementation, you can afford to incorporate small infrastructure upgrades into everyday tasks. This mindset shifts AI from being just a task executor to a continuous system improver.

* Identify which parts of the codebase are the “source of truth” for shared logic — and actively reference them in prompts, don’t just leave it to the AI to guess.
* Ask the AI to suggest improvements when reusing code: *“If this utility seems outdated or has gaps, refactor it for consistency with X.”*

4. **Adopt Practices That Surface the Unsaid for True Alignment**Lean into test-driven development (TDD). Now that AI can generate tests with minimal friction, you should make test-first workflows your default. This isn’t just about catching bugs after the fact—it’s about identifying misalignments *before* implementation even begins. By asking the AI to write tests based on your intent first, you expose any assumptions, contradictions, or vague logic early in the process.  
   TDD forces clarity. It transforms uncertainty into executable expectations — and ensures that every implementation is grounded in shared understanding. The result is software that not only works, but remains maintainable and test-covered over time.

1. * Before writing a single line of implementation code, prompt the AI to generate tests that describe the feature’s expected behavior.
   * Review the generated tests closely — they reflect how the AI interprets your intent. Clarify or reframe as needed to resolve any mismatches before coding begins.
   * Make this your default habit: *test first, then build*. It keeps both humans and machines aligned from the outset.

5. **Stay in Sync With the Evolving Codebase**Use AI tools that summarize PRs and track code evolution. Actively read those summaries. While agents stay perfectly up-to-date with every change, humans don’t. You need to invest effort in maintaining architectural awareness, especially as AI speeds up development. Understanding what’s changing across the system is critical to making informed decisions and avoiding drift.

1. * Subscribe to merged PR summaries and carve out small buckets of time to skim them daily, it’s worth it.

These techniques define the modern software orchestrator: someone who thinks in systems, defines intent, uses AI as a collaborator — not just a code producer — and builds with future-readiness in mind.

**Less riffing, more orchestrating. That’s a future we can actually maintain.**
