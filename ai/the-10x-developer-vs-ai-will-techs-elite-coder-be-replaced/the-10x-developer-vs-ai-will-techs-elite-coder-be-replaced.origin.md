The mythical 10x developer. In our industry, it’s as rare as a unicorn. It’s the [George Hotz-type](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/02/george-hotz-aka-geohot-is-leaving-comma-ai-for-a-lofty-ai-project/) — the kind of developer who can code a neural network from scratch in hours, jailbreak an iPhone as a teenager, and get sued by Sony for millions for cracking the PS3. These rare beasts who can churn out code at a pace unmatched by their peers have long been the holy grail for tech companies. But, in the age of AI, is their position at the top of the developer hierarchy under threat?

Firstly, some background. I founded [Cosine](https://cosine.sh/), a Y Combinator-backed AI company. I’ve been elbow-deep in developing [AI tools](https://thenewstack.io/2-open-source-ai-tools-that-reduce-devops-friction/) for software engineering for years. We work closely with — and have the backing of — OpenAI, and our work on Genie, our own AI, means I can confidently say that AI is already rewriting the rules of what it means to be a top performer in software engineering. And it’s raising some seriously thorny questions about how we hire structure [teams and even think about software development](https://thenewstack.io/managing-software-development-team-dynamics-from-within/) itself.

What’s unprecedented is the speed at which this transformation is occurring. We’re seeing changes in months that we expected to take years. Companies need to adapt now or risk being left behind in what could be the most significant shift in [software development](https://thenewstack.io/feds-critical-software-must-drop-c-c-by-2026-or-face-risk/) since the internet itself.

I often hear the word “productivity” being thrown around when we talk about AI, even more so when we talk about AI and coding. It feels misplaced. Too often, we are focused on output rather than outcome. Too frequently, importance is placed on the number of lines of code that a software developer can write rather than how they are used. For me, productivity is more subjective. It’s the ability to get a job done but get it done correctly. It’s deploying lines of code that need little revision in the future. It’s executing at speed but executing well.

**When AI Outperforms Your Best Coders**
The proof is in the pudding. We’re seeing AI tools that can smash out complex coding tasks in minutes and take even your best senior devs’ hours. At Cosine, we’ve seen this firsthand with our AI, Genie. Many of the tasks we tested were in the four to six-hour range, and Genie could complete them in four to six minutes. It’s a genuine superhuman thing to be able to solve problems that quickly.

But here’s where it gets interesting. This isn’t just about raw output. The real mind-bender is that AI is starting to think like an engineer. It’s not just spitting out code — it’s solving problems. Historically AI in software development existed in a silo — almost like locking a team of software engineers in a dark room and handing them tasks to complete without any awareness of the bigger picture. Now AI is painting that very picture.

**From Code Monkey to AI Puppeteer**
So… what happens to your rockstar devs when AI can outcode them? Well, they’re going to need a new playbook. I believe the future “high-performing engineer” isn’t just a backend or frontend specialist. A high-performing engineer is someone who can do it all. In our space, it is someone who could fix a backend problem and then ship a frontend feature in the same breath.

Think less code monkey and more AI orchestrator. The value will be knowing how to architect solutions and tell the AI how to build them. It’s a whole new skill set that will separate the haves from the have-nots in our industry.

**The New Developer Career Path**
What happens when your bright-eyed junior dev can leverage AI to perform at senior levels? It’s not as far-fetched as it sounds. The truth is, at least to start with, in the next couple of years, these products will still complement the junior engineer. There’s an argument to be made that junior engineers will ship much more than they used to and be able to have much higher levels of output. Of course, the long-term effects have yet to be seen. Suppose we’re looking slightly more pragmatically at what AI could signal for career progression. In that case, there is a counterargument that junior developers won’t be exposed to the same level of problem-solving or acquire the same skill sets, given the availability of AI.

This creates a complete headache for HR. How do you structure career progression when the traditional markers of seniority — years of experience, deep technical knowledge — might not mean as much? I think we’ll see a shift in focus. Companies will probably lean more on whether you fulfilled your sprint objectives and shipped what you wanted on time instead of going deeper.

As for the companies themselves? Those who don’t get on board with AI coding tools will get left in the dust. As Amazon’s CEO Andy Jassy put it, there’s a [potential 4,500-year productivity gap](https://x.com/ajassy/status/1826608791741493281) between those redesigning their entire approach to software development and those who refuse to do so.

**So What’s a Dev To Do?**
If you’re a developer reading this and starting to sweat, take a breath. There’s still plenty of room for human talent — it will look different. Get good at using AI tools. Become the person who knows how to use Copilot or whatever it is. Become the one who can extract the most value out of these things.

For managers, it’s crucial to start integrating AI tools into their development processes now. Begin by identifying tasks AI can handle efficiently, freeing up your human [developers for more complex](https://thenewstack.io/is-ai-the-antidote-to-software-development-complexity/), creative work. Invest in training your team to work alongside AI, focusing on skills like prompt engineering and AI output validation.

And as for the future of dev teams? I think they will undoubtedly get smaller. I don’t necessarily think that’s a bad thing. You’ll get far more companies of between 10 to 20 people producing vast software than hundreds of devs would have traditionally done. I’m seeing companies leverage AI coding tools to ship products at breakneck speeds, squashing bugs left and right and doing it all without breaking the bank.

[Software development will be a wild ride in the next](https://thenewstack.io/social-intelligence-is-the-next-big-step-for-ai/) few years. I probably can’t tell you what the landscape will look like in five years because everything changes so fast. I can say with some confidence, however, that a top-tier developer will look very different from what it does now. Consequently, companies will need to change their perception of what a high-performing dev team looks like pretty fast.
