There are plenty of reasons for businesses to adopt AI agents, which can boost productivity and reduce employee tedium.

There are also plenty of ways in which AI agent implementations can fail — and as more and more organizations move to adopt agentic AI, the smart ones will think proactively about how to get ahead of the pitfalls that could cause agentic projects to go awry.

As someone who has deployed a number of AI agents both for internal use and on behalf of enterprise clients, I’ve learned a thing or two about how to avoid AI agent implementation failure. Read on for my take on the major causes of failure, along with tips on mitigating them.

## What Are AI Agents, and How Can Businesses Use Them?

An AI agent is an autonomous software system that perceives its environment, makes decisions and takes action.

By creating custom agents aligned with specific use cases, organizations can partially or fully automate complex tasks that would previously have required manual effort on the part of employees.

Agentic AI technology is relatively new, with production-ready agentic AI technology and frameworks (such as the [Model Context Protocol](https://thenewstack.io/model-context-protocol-a-primer-for-the-developers/), or MCP) having become available just over the past year or so. Nonetheless, AI agents are already gaining a widespread presence in business environments: According to IDC research from summer 2025, [34.1 percent of enterprises](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US53383725) had already begun adopting agentic AI as of that time.

## The Top Causes of Agentic AI Adoption Failure

But again, it’s one thing to start implementing AI agents. It’s another to complete the project successfully. Here’s a look at the main reasons why agentic AI implementations can fail.

### 1. Unrealistic Expectations

AI agents are a powerful type of solution capable of automating tasks and workflows that would otherwise require manual effort. But they can’t perform magic. They may fail to complete highly complex tasks, or those that require types of context awareness (like an understanding of human emotions) that only people can bring to the table.

This isn’t to say that AI agents can’t be helpful in cases like these. They may still be useful, but only if they work alongside of – instead of in place of – humans. In other words, it’s often necessary to keep a “human in the loop” for AI agents to achieve their goals.

It’s also often the case that agents struggle to excel at their intended tasks out of the gate. Usually, they [must undergo an iterative development process before they become](https://thenewstack.io/engineers-must-become-agile-collaboration-ninjas/) capable of meeting expectations, which means they may not start delivering business value as fast as executives want or expect.

Failure to understand these limitations, or the setting of unrealistic expectations for what AI agents can do, is one frequent reason why implementations don’t fully achieve their goals.

### 2. Poor Use Case Prioritization

Given the tremendous potential of AI agents, it can be tempting for organizations to attempt to develop custom [agents designed to handle every possible use case or workflow](https://thenewstack.io/semantic-router-and-its-role-in-designing-agentic-workflows/).

This is a mistake for most companies because it leaves them in the position of biting off more than they can chew. If your organization is new to the implementation and management of AI agents, it should start simple by targeting use cases where tasks are clearly defined and outcomes are easy to measure (such as deploying a software application or writing data to a database, to name a couple of examples).

Only after achieving success in these tasks should the organization move onto more complex use cases. Trying to tackle complex tasks that involve multiple variables or systems out of the gate won’t set you on the path to success.

### 3. Data Quality Issues

The old “garbage in, garbage out” adage applies to many types of IT systems. But it’s especially relevant for AI agents, which will struggle to operate effectively if they lack access to the right types of data, or if the data they work with is low in quality.

This is why it’s critical to ensure that [AI agents are exposed to the data](https://thenewstack.io/system-two-ai-the-dawn-of-reasoning-agents-in-business/) they need to achieve intended tasks. (They should not, of course, be able to access resources that are irrelevant for their intended use cases, since this creates a security risk.) Often, this includes not just easily manageable resources, like structured databases, but also free-form, unstructured data, such as collections of documents.

Equally important is cleaning data to avoid missing, incomplete, outdated or stale information before exposing it to agents — such as situations where customer information without one [source conflicts with data](https://thenewstack.io/dispelling-myths-of-open-source-complexity-with-apache-iceberg/) in another. Without accurate and consistent data, agents are more likely to make the wrong decisions because they can’t interpret their environments effectively.

### 4. Governance Challenges

The ability to track what agents are doing by logging and auditing their [activity is critical for governance and security](https://thenewstack.io/how-attackers-move-from-azure-active-directory-to-on-prem-ad/). This visibility also [plays an important role in agent development](https://thenewstack.io/playing-dd-with-ai-the-agentic-ai-developers-achilles-heel/) and enhancement, since logging and audit trails are necessary for identifying mistakes (like unintended modification of sensitive data) and correcting them through the implementation of new guardrails.

Unfortunately, most agentic AI frameworks at present offer limited built-in features for addressing these challenges. But with enough development efforts, it’s possible to implement custom governance solutions to support successful agentic AI adoption. It’s more work than adopting an off-the-shelf solution and calling it a day, but it’s necessary for balancing AI agents’ power with potential governance risks.

## A Production-Ready Approach to Agentic AI Adoption

If the challenges I’ve laid out above sound familiar, it’s probably because many of the same issues are at stake during generative AI adoption. That said, AI agents double down on some of these challenges because, unlike generative AI systems, agents don’t just create content. They can take independent actions that directly impact the performance and reliability of IT systems, which is why getting things right from the start is so important when developing an agentic AI adoption and implementation strategy.
