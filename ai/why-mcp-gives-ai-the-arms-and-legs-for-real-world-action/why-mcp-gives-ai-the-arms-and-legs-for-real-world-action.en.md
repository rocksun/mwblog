The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is getting a lot of attention right now — and in this case, it’s well deserved. MCP is a significant step in equipping AI with arms and legs to significantly enhance existing business functionality and make all our lives a little easier. While recent AI advances have enabled large language models to solve problems, they have so far lacked the ability to act in the real world, interacting with systems that people use every day.

MCP servers, frequently referred to simply as MCPs, are the missing link that enables AI to take action, not just chat and advise. Block was one of the first adopters of the MCP and helped shape some of its key features, including security and efficient data sorting. In particular, our financial services focus provides us with a unique perspective on security and data privacy.

## How MCP Enables AI to Take Action in the Real World

The idea behind MCPs is practical. Most organizations already have a wealth of software, like APIs, back-office tools, and workflow engines, built and working. The real challenge is not creating new AI-native applications from scratch, but rather connecting AI agents to the existing systems already in place. With MCPs, even legacy or niche tools become instantly automatable through AI.

We’re already witnessing the early stages of this shift with Square sellers. Today, a business owner can use natural language to query their inventory, simply asking, “Do I have enough inventory for the weekend?” Next up, powered by [Square MCP,](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/mcp) this query will seamlessly transition into agentic action: sellers will be able to say, “If not, order whatever I need to get us through the weekend.”

Behind the scenes, AI agents will orchestrate every step, not just responding but actively interacting across systems: checking inventory levels, analyzing historical sales trends, and autonomously placing necessary orders. Looking further ahead, these agents will proactively identify trends, suggest business improvements, and even address issues behind the scenes, preventing potential problems from surfacing.

The same foundational approach carries across sectors. Wherever software exposes an API, MCPs [take them a step further](https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/04/22/mcp-is-rewriting-the-rules-of-api-integration) and give agentic frameworks like [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) the arms and legs to mediate between LLMs and existing systems. You may be using your AI Agent to pull data from Snowflake, analyze it in Databricks, generate insights and publish them to a Google Doc. MCPs are the gateways your AI Agent uses to talk to those systems in a standardized manner.

At Block, what began as a developer tool for a small engineering team has evolved into a company-wide platform that 60% of Block’s 10,000 employees use weekly to automate complex workflows and eliminate routine tasks across various departments, including legal, sales, marketing, and more.

Some of Block’s risk analysts have begun using Goose to accelerate fraud detection processes. Where traditional analysis required days of manual data review, these analysts can now request comprehensive fraud analysis through natural language queries.

Block’s sales operations team recently experimented with using Goose for a complex lead analysis project involving 81,000 sales leads. Rather than conducting weeks of manual analysis, the team used Goose to access lead data through Databricks connections, analyze patterns, and generate distribution recommendations. The analysis and strategic recommendations were completed in one hour.

## Key Considerations for Implementing MCP

With the right playbook in place, MCPs can provide the server your company needs for agentic AI to truly connect your company in ways that were not previously possible. Some things to consider:

1. **Open source by default:** We were able to do all of this because we open sourced everything, and we’ve made a bunch of our internal MCPs open source as well. When we make things open source by default, we’re not just sharing code, we’re inviting everyone to dream bigger and build better together.
2. **Prioritize improving existing tools and processes:** One of the best parts of adopting this new agent architecture is that it doesn’t mean throwing away what already works. At Block, we prioritized building internal MCP extensions around the tools that we’re already using today.
3. **Security and lineage have to be front of mind from the start:** We designed Block’s internal MCP-based applications to operate behind robust authentication, with clear audit trails and fine-grained controls. We’re also contributing to the [security of the protocol itself](https://block.github.io/goose/blog/2025/03/31/securing-mcp/) (and you can, too).

## The Future of MCP and Agentic Automation

As the protocol matures, MCPs will become as fundamental to the developer’s toolkit as REST or container standards did in earlier eras. The most powerful technology ecosystems emerge from solutions that prove themselves in real environments and then become shared by communities. MCPs already benefit from this network effect, and each new adapter or endpoint instantly increases the value of all agents that speak MCP.

The promise of AI is about unlocking the value of what’s already been built. With MCPs, the full power of today’s AI can be leveraged to optimize the systems and workflows that matter most, while maintaining security, context, and human oversight. The protocol’s value will only grow as more organizations and industries adopt it and as developers continue to iterate in the open, grounded in what delivers the highest signal and real-world utility.

The era of agentic automation is here, and with MCPs, AI finally has the arms and legs to transform work everywhere with practical, lasting impact.
