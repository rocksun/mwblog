If 2025 was the year of AI adoption, with [88% of organizations](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai) now using AI across at least one business function, 2026 is likely to be the year of the AI incident. As AI systems are deployed at speed, gaps in governance, oversight, and resilience are surfacing. In this environment, IT operations (ITOps) teams must prepare for AI incidents and rethink traditional operations management processes to reflect the changing nature of risk.

In the year ahead, three shifts will define the way organizations manage, respond to, and [communicate around AI incidents](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-streamline-communication-during-incidents/).

## **AI incidents will become their own category**

As AI becomes more deeply embedded in business operations, organizations will treat [AI incidents as a distinct category requiring specific remediation](https://thenewstack.io/5-ways-to-supercharge-incident-remediation-with-automation/) processes. Greater adoption introduces new failure modes, particularly where third-party AI tools are given access to secure data and internal systems.

When AI systems fail, the damage can be severe. [An IBM survey](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach#:~:text=The%20AI%20oversight%20gap,Risks%2C%20Shadow%20AI%2C%20&%20Solutions) found that 63% of organizations lack formal governance policies to manage AI or prevent the spread of shadow AI, highlighting how unprepared many remain for AI-related operational risk. To tackle this, organizations must prioritize responsible AI adoption and put safeguards in place before incidents occur.

In response to new failure modes, organizations are beginning to measure AI reliability as an operational metric. This allows teams to assess how effectively AI tools complete tasks and determine when intervention is required. Key indicators may include hallucination rates, bias, and model drift. We can expect AI-specific runbooks to emerge to address these risks, alongside security threats like prompt injection attacks.

While the [role of AI and automation in operations management](https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-and-automation-can-improve-operational-resiliency/) will continue to evolve, the risk of AI incidents means organizations must retain a human in the loop as a critical safeguard, and should ensure that AI tooling requests approval for risky actions. This provides a manual override option when automated processes fail and ensures human-led quality control remains in place to monitor and manage AI reliability.

## **The makeup of teams will be transformed**

AI incidents cut across teams and business functions, forcing ITOps teams to [rethink the way incident management is organized](https://thenewstack.io/what-can-incident-teams-learn-from-crisis-management/). In practice, this will mean prioritizing cross-functional training, expanding the range of roles involved in incident remediation, and reducing reliance on a small group of specialist responders. Over time, this shift will [break down traditional operational silos](https://thenewstack.io/breaking-down-the-barriers-to-operational-innovation/) and distribute responsibility more evenly across teams.

Because AI incidents are rarely confined to a single system, their impact often spans multiple business units and affects both internal teams and customers. As a result, incident remediation will increasingly involve subject matter experts from nontechnical backgrounds who would normally not take part in resolution. Organizations should consider this broader group when designing incident management training and response processes.

This shift also has implications for on-call structures. Rotations that combine deep technical expertise with broader, multiteam participation are essential, as this team setup ensures that machine learning (ML) engineers and data scientists are available alongside nontechnical roles that understand customer impact and business context. Together, these groups can collaborate to resolve AI incidents outside of business hours, minimizing disruption to both systems and customers.

## **Communications strategies will mature**

Given that AI incidents are more complex and cross-cutting, communication needs to change accordingly. Incident communications must move beyond static status updates to provide timely, accurate explanations of impact and next steps, particularly when customers and stakeholders are affected.

When incidents occur, customers expect clarity on how they are affected and visibility into the resolution process, not just a status page that turns red.

AI-assisted communications allow organizations to move beyond reactive notifications and proactively explain impact and next steps in real time. This timeliness and precision allow customers to take action and minimize downstream effects on their own services.

Organizations that use AI and automation to improve the speed and accuracy of incident communications can turn trust-eroding events into trust-building moments of transparency. In this way, they differentiate themselves not by avoiding incidents altogether, but by demonstrating accountability and clear communication when failures occur.

## **Adapting to the changing face of incidents**

The rapid adoption of AI marks a new phase for operations management, reshaping how incidents are identified, managed, and communicated. Organizations must adapt to survive because those with slow, reactive incident management processes will falter in the age of AI incidents.

Organizations shifting to proactive, intelligence-led operations are best positioned to keep up with this change. AI and automation-supported tools help teams anticipate incidents and predict future events to apply fixes preemptively. Those that modernize their operations management practices will be better positioned to manage AI-related risk and maintain trust.

In the age of AI, operational resilience is no longer optional. It is a defining capability.
