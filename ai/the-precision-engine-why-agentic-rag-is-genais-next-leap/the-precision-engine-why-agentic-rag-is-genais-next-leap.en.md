When a major airline’s LLM-based chatbot hallucinated a discount policy and the airline had to honor it, the incident underscored the need for precise, trusted GenAI systems. This story and many like that have since become a cautionary tale for developers building with generative AI.

Today, as more businesses integrate generative models into production workflows, decision-making systems and customer-facing applications precision has become a non-negotiable differentiator. In fact, 74% of IT leaders expect [GenAI use to keep surging](http://report.confluent.io). Without precision, your AI outputs veer into misinformation, brand-damaging inaccuracies or decisions that erode user trust.

High-precision outputs mean your AI is solving the problems correctly, driving return on investment, and ensuring consistent, high-quality performance. This is how your [GenAI solution](https://thenewstack.io/7-best-practices-for-developers-getting-started-with-genai/) transforms into a long-term competitive advantage.

## Grounding GenAI in Reality: The Role and Limits of RAG

One data-centric optimization approach for enhancing precision is through [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://www.confluent.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/). RAG enables LLMs to be more accurate in domain-specific contexts by simply grounding the response in [up-to-date knowledge](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-scale-rag-and-build-more-accurate-llms/).

* There are also cons. RAG systems have their own set of limitations and challenges across the retrieval,augmentation and generation phases:
* **Missing or outdated content:** If the knowledge base lacks coverage — or worse, it’s outdated — the model still “fills the gaps,” with guesses. It’s a tricky situation with high risk.
* **Signal-to-noise ratio:** Your model might struggle to extract accurate information when confronted with conflicting or off-topic content, leading to inconsistent outputs and user frustration.
* **Limited memory and context:** Long conversations can exceed context windows, causing context drift and repetition, which ultimately degrade output quality over multiturn engagements.
* **Crude chunking and vector limits:** Short context chunks may not provide the full picture. Retrieval mechanisms like approximate nearest neighbor (aNN) and K-nearest neighbor (kNN) can become noisy and slow when dealing with large data sets, resulting in lower recall. Or slow down your app with latency and compute costs.
* **No feedback loop:** Classic RAG methodologies don’t self-check or iterate, allowing errors to propagate. They lack robust, automated mechanisms for self-improvement based on output quality.

## Beyond Basic RAG: Enter Agentic RAG

You can try several approaches to improve RAG retrieval, such as reranking and domain-specific tuning, but agentic RAG architecture takes your solution further. It transforms static RAG pipelines into adaptive, intelligent systems. It does this by introducing one or more types of specialized [AI agents](https://www.confluent.io/learn/agentic-ai/) that have a judge mechanism. The result of such systems drives higher-quality outputs with each run.

Instead of being locked to a single RAG solution, [agentic RAG allows your LLM to pull from multiple data sources and tools](https://thenewstack.io/a2a-mcp-kafka-and-flink-the-new-stack-for-ai-agents/), offering greater flexibility. Unlike traditional RAG, which reacts to queries with minimal adaptation, agentic RAG can change its retrieval strategy mid-flight based on context. With systems of multi-agents working together, you can build scalable AI systems that can handle a wide range of user queries. These agents don’t just work once and move on — they iterate on past results. Over time, this boosts system accuracy. Plus, they’re not limited to text: Advanced multimodal models let them process images, audio and more.

Anthropic’s internal evaluations, for instance, show that “a multi-agent system with Claude Opus 4 as the lead agent and Claude Sonnet 4 subagents outperformed single-agent Claude Opus 4 by 90.2%.”

Another example is the recent research work [RAGentA framework](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.16988). A collaborative multi-agent RAG framework that increases answer faithfulness by 10.72 % over standard RAG baselines.

One highly used multi-agent design pattern is the agentic [blackboard pattern](https://www.confluent.io/blog/event-driven-multi-agent-systems/). This pattern is used for solving complex problems that require incremental solutions, where agents asynchronously collaborate through a shared knowledge base — a “blackboard.” Similar to coworkers in a fast-moving digital workspace, each agent brings a different skill to the table. Some specialize in retrieving information, others analyze patterns and a few verify findings before anything gets shared. They autonomously and asynchronously contribute to a shared board where insights are posted, refined and reused.

[![Blackboard pattern](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/08/fa02b4ad-image2-1024x496.png)](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/08/fa02b4ad-image2-1024x496.png)

**How it works:**

* **Initialization:** The board is seeded with initial data.
* **Agent activation:** Agents monitor the board and contribute when their expertise matches the current state.
* **Iterative refinement:** Agents incrementally update the board until a solution emerges.

In a medical diagnosis scenario, for example, different agents would have access to different pockets of patient and clinical data, such as symptoms, lab results and medical history. When a user inputs symptoms, the appropriate agent retrieves relevant diagnostic possibilities and posts them to the shared blackboard. As a diagnosis emerges, it’s broadcast back to all agents, creating a feedback loop where each agent learns from the outcome and adjusts its reasoning over time. This helps agents become more effective and precise in future diagnoses.

## 5 Ways Agentic RAG Elevates Precision

Here’s how agentic RAG levels up output quality and factuality, turning a static pipeline into a collaborative system of specialized “microservices” that reason, evaluate and adapt in real time:

1. **Query planning and decomposition:**  Acting like a request router in a microservices architecture, a planning agent breaks down complex queries into smaller, well-defined tasks. This avoids vague or overly broad retrieval, ensuring the right facts are surfaced early and precisely. This ensures RAG pipeline efficiency.
2. **Adaptive hybrid retrieval strategy:** Think of it as a load balancer for knowledge retrieval. Unlike traditional vector-only retrieval, a retriever agent chooses the best retrieving strategy: term-based, graph-based, vectorDB or API calls, tailored to each sub-task.
3. **Evidence judging and verification:** Similar to quality gates in your machine learning or CI/CD pipelines, a judge agent scores retrieved information for factual relevance and internal consistency before it enters the generation stage to effectively filter out noise.
4. **Self-reflective revision:** Once a draft is generated, a revision agent checks the overall flow process, validating the relevance of the input query to the answer/output. This mechanism can also be external and dependent on the main agent output.
5. **Long-term memory and structured retrieval:** Memory can be thought of as a cache layer. Memory agents store filtered insights and user preferences from past interactions, then use structured retrieval augmentation to context when it’s necessary.

But for these agents to deliver precision at scale, they need constant access to data, tools and the ability to share information across systems, with their outputs available for use by multiple services. That’s not just an AI challenge, it’s an infrastructure and [data interoperability problem](https://thenewstack.io/ai-wont-save-you-from-your-data-modeling-problems/).
