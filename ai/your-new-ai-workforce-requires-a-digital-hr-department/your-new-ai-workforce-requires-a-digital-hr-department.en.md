AI agents are beginning to permeate enterprises, driving the need for new teams and processes to help manage this growing workforce of non-human employees.

Whether they centralize the work into a “digital human resources” department or run it in other unified ways across the organization, businesses need mechanisms to ensure every AI agent performs appropriately. That means having the [right security and governance](https://thenewstack.io/5-ways-to-transform-itops-with-a-human-and-ai-agent-model/) across the thousands of daily interactions the agents will have with humans and other agentic systems. It also requires key capabilities, like evaluation, [monitoring and observability](https://thenewstack.io/monitoring-vs-observability-whats-the-difference/ "monitoring and observability").

But enterprises must also eliminate organizational silos to enable [deeper collaboration](https://thenewstack.io/will-ai-replace-human-project-managers-not-so-fast/) among technologists, traditional HR roles and end users. These new, blended cohorts will help make key decisions, like when to build or buy, as well as rethink operations to make sure [humans and machines are both performing at their best](https://thenewstack.io/50-50-the-future-of-human-ai-collaboration-for-innovation/). And ultimately, in-house specialists are critical to successfully deploying and scaling AI agents that understand every company’s unique domain.

Here’s what organizations should consider when building their own internal teams and processes to support the agentic AI future.

## **Rethink Traditional HR Teams**

As the adoption of AI agents grows, companies must evaluate more than their IT landscape. Leaders will need to reimagine employee roles and KPIs (key performance indicators). Reporting structures may need to change, as well as incentives.

For example, in the early days of deployment, the technology can help automate more routine responsibilities. Developers, for example, may be expected to ship new products faster using AI-generated code. Or marketing teams might rely on an AI agent instead of a junior associate to conduct competitive research, freeing early career employees to work more closely with senior partners on higher-value assignments and learn the business faster.

But as deep reasoning capabilities evolve and improve, AI agents will also be able to handle more cognitively challenging tasks. They might not replace humans at complex jobs, but the AI agents can augment an employee’s speed and performance at the task. For example, an AI agent that can scan medical records, X-rays or other sources to deliver a high-quality, preliminary diagnosis could upend the way physicians typically spend their days. Instead of reviewing documentation, doctors can focus on providing care, potentially helping them attend to more patients.

Meanwhile, deeper input is needed in the “hiring” process to ensure that investments are targeting the right areas of opportunity. As a result, those who manage the human capital component must work more closely with IT teams that understand the technology. And those traditional HR managers must also collaborate with the end users who will soon be infusing the AI solution into their day-to-day workflows. Such coordination will be crucial to aligning needs and budgets.

Take a common use case: a new customer-support AI agent. Before investing in the solution, IT teams should coordinate with human call-center agents to figure out their biggest pain points. It makes sense to start with specific tasks to automate, using pilot projects to work out the kinks. Amid this process, HR teams should work with both stakeholder groups to understand how the technology will affect operations. Only after all the variables have been thought through and tested should the product go live.

This could mean potentially revising hiring plans and KPIs. For example, existing call-center employees may be evaluated less on the number of calls they handle every day, and instead on factors like the quality of the service they deliver — or their human skills that could be put to better use on behalf of the organization.

## **Build, Buy or Outsource?**

With such a vast array of AI agents at their disposal, companies must become more discerning about which systems to invest in, which to buy off the shelf and which to add to existing IT platforms:

* **Build the AI leadership team:** In the same way businesses are willing to pay top dollar for the most talented industry executives, organizations should reserve the biggest AI investments for mission-critical use cases that drive differentiated capabilities and outcomes.
* **Buy and train the new “hires”:** There are many instances when off-the-shelf AI won’t work, and yet there’s not enough investment return to build a solution internally. In these instances, similar to the way associates must be trained by more tenured employees, businesses will need to use proprietary data and internal expertise to achieve the performance they require from AI agents.
* **Outsource the basic capabilities**: Every software vendor is infusing basic AI tools into their platforms. While they can help users get better performance out of their customer relationship management (CRM), health cost and risk management (HCRM) or other system, the features are often limited to just that software ecosystem. Enterprises should invest in these appropriately, but ensure that the bulk of the investment aims to further differentiate the company from rivals. And when possible, businesses should connect the data from these disparate silos into a unified platform to build applications on top of the unified assets.

## **The New HR Era: Agent Capital Management**

Once they’re “hired,” every AI agent will require coaching, feedback and evaluation to be successful. This is where capabilities like monitoring, governance and observability become key.

Before any human new hire starts, whether a junior associate or a C-suite member, they’re assigned a digital identity that includes access to the systems they need to do their job. Similarly, AI agents need the right governance in place before they’re let loose into operations.

Meanwhile, companies must be able to monitor the AI agents and their interactions in real time. And when issues arise, they need to pinpoint with precision and speed what went wrong — and address the underlying issues so they don’t happen again.

Successfully blending human and machine intelligence takes more than simply adopting a new IT solution. Businesses must rethink processes, remove organizational silos and reimagine how they manage human employees alongside the growing AI agent workforce.

Now and in the future, it’s the only sure way to get the best from people and technology.
