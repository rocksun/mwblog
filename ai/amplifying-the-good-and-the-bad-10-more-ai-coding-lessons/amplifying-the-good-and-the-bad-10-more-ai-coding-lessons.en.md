After sharing my first “Top 10” post, several colleagues and readers reached out to continue the conversation. Many of us have come across new insights, surprises and strategies for integrating AI into our workflows. Here are 10 more reflections on what it’s like to bring a synthetic partner into daily development, focusing on rhythm, personality, collaboration and the subtle cultural shifts AI introduces.

### 1. AI Changes the Rhythm of Coding

In the past, coding was often a solo, deeply focused activity. Now, with AI as a conversational partner, the process feels more like a dialogue. Sometimes this means a faster feedback loop, but it also means learning how to keep control of the tempo. It’s easy to let the AI rush ahead; the real challenge is knowing when to slow down and think.

### 2. The Problem of ‘Too Much Help’

Ironically, one of the biggest surprises is that AI can be too eager. It assumes, extrapolates and often over-rotates. The analogy I’ve used is that of an overeager first date — constantly trying to finish your sentences. That means the skill of working with AI isn’t about extracting more, but about reigning it in. Boundaries become essential.

### 3. Personality Matters More Than I Expected

Developers are often stereotyped as being introspective or introverted. But working with AI makes our communication style visible. If you’re someone who thrives on explaining, narrating or teaching (like me — my kids say I overexplain everything), AI can feel like a natural partner. For those who prefer to stay quiet and internal, the constant dialogue might feel jarring. This raises the question: Does AI coding favor certain personalities over others?

### 4. The Hidden Danger of ‘Lazy Detail’

I’ve been playing the game “Firmament,” from the creators of “Myst” and “Riven.” While beautiful, it somehow lacks the artisanal detail I loved in their earlier work. Later, I learned that AI had been used in its ideation, and I wondered: Was that what I felt was missing? If users can feel the difference between handcrafted and AI-generated work in a game, could the same be true for the code and experiences we create? It’s a reminder that we need to guard against cutting corners just because the machine makes it easy.

### 5. The Need To Articulate Intent

One unexpected benefit of working with AI is how much it makes us clarify our thoughts. Explaining a problem to a machine isn’t so different from explaining to a new teammate. You can’t rely on intuition alone — you need to be precise. And in that precision, we often discover what we *really* meant.

### 6. ‘TIL’ Moments Multiply

If I could send a message back to my pre-AI self, it would be this: You’ll learn something new almost every single day. The AI doesn’t just give answers; it changes the way you frame questions. Each prompt becomes a chance to discover an unexpected angle, a fresh shortcut or a better metaphor. AI makes “today I learned” less of an occasional insight and more of a daily rhythm.

### 7. A New Collaboration Etiquette

At work, collaboration with people has rules, rhythms and a culture. With AI, we’re having to invent new ones. Do you let it propose first or do you outline the shape of a solution and then ask for refinements? Do you trust it to suggest tests, or is that still sacred ground? We’re writing a new kind of etiquette in real time.

### 8. Stretching the Engineer Stereotype

Traditionally, engineers were imagined as heads-down problem solvers, working quietly and independently. With AI, that stereotype is breaking down. Suddenly, the “soft skills” of explaining, mentoring and dialogue aren’t optional — they’re central. We may be witnessing the emergence of a new kind of developer personality: part builder, part coach, part conversationalist.

### 9. AI Amplifies Both Discipline and Drift

Used well, AI can make us sharper and more disciplined. It can keep our conventions consistent, remind us of edge cases and help us think modularly. But it can also make us drift, skipping past fundamentals and leaning on the machine’s assumptions. The difference isn’t in the tool; it’s in the way we wield it.

### 10. The Future Feels More Social Than Solitary

The biggest revelation of all: Coding no longer feels lonely. Whether you love or dislike that shift, it’s undeniable. The act of creation now involves dialogue, even if one of the partners isn’t human. The future of software development may not be about replacing the human spark, but about reshaping it into something more conversational, more interactive and maybe, more human than before.

## A Closing Thought

My first top 10 article captured the novelty of AI integration; this latest one captures the subtler shifts — the changes in rhythm, personality and culture. We are not just coding differently; we are becoming different kinds of coders. Some of those changes are exciting, some unsettling, but all are worth noticing.
