The rise of AI-powered tools such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT has sparked considerable interest in how AI can assist developers in generating and using API SDKs (Software Development Kits). With its potential to streamline repetitive coding tasks, AI presents an exciting opportunity for enhancing API workflows. However, this new approach also comes with notable challenges, including issues of reliability, security and nondeterminism.

In this article, we’ll dive deep into the role AI can play as a copilot in SDK generation, examine common pitfalls like hallucinations, and explore how AI can complement traditional code generation methods to offer a balanced and efficient development experience.

**The Potential of AI in SDK Generation**
APIs are the backbone of modern software applications, enabling different systems to communicate with one another. SDKs simplify API usage by offering developers prepackaged libraries and tools. Traditionally, SDK generation has been a manual, time-consuming process. However, recent advancements in AI have opened up new possibilities for automating SDK creation.

One of the key advantages of AI in SDK generation is its ability to handle mundane, repetitive tasks. By parsing through OpenAPI specifications or API documentation, AI can automate the creation of models, services and other components needed to build an SDK. This cuts down on manual labor, enabling developers to focus on more complex and creative tasks.

For example, platforms like [APIMatic](https://www.apimatic.io/) are experimenting with AI to improve developer experiences by training AI to work alongside traditional code generation tools. In this hybrid model, AI can dynamically answer developer queries and explore API documentation, while deterministic code generators handle the reliable creation of static API access code.

## Example: Spotify API
The C# code below demonstrates how to interact with the [Spotify API](https://apimatic-api-copilot.netlify.app/#/net-standard-library/quick-start/overview) to create a new playlist, fetch an artist’s top tracks and add those tracks to the created playlist using the Spotify Web API SDK. It was generated by an API copilot from APIMatic in response to the query: “How to create a new playlist and add the 10 most popular Taylor Swift songs?”

This code handles the full workflow of:

**Authenticating via OAuth 2.0**with the necessary permissions to modify the user’s playlists.**Creating a new playlist**for the user using Spotify’s API.**Fetching the top tracks**of Taylor Swift.**Adding the fetched tracks**to the newly created playlist.
Here’s a breakdown of the code.

### 1. Authorization Setup
The code starts by setting up OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow to gain access to Spotify’s API. It defines the OAuth client ID, client secret and redirect URI, and requests the necessary scopes for managing playlists:

`PlaylistModifyPrivate`
: Modify private playlists.`PlaylistModifyPublic`
: Modify public playlists.
The client obtains an OAuth token after user consent by redirecting them to the Spotify authorization page. This token is then used to authenticate API calls.

### 2. Creating a New Playlist
After authorization, a `PlaylistsController`
is instantiated to interact with playlists. A playlist with the name “Taylor Swift Top 10” is created using the `CreatePlaylistAsync`
method, with parameters for privacy and description.

### 3. Fetching Taylor Swift’s Top Tracks
The `ArtistsController`
is used to fetch Taylor Swift’s top tracks with `GetAnArtistsTopTracksAsync`
, specifying the artist’s Spotify ID (06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02) and market (US). The result is a list of top tracks, including their URIs (unique Spotify track identifiers).

### 4. Adding Tracks to Playlist
The code then adds these top tracks to the newly created playlist using `AddTracksToPlaylistAsync`
. It sends a list of track URIs to the playlist using the `playlistId`
obtained from the playlist creation response.

**How It Works**
**OAuth Flow**: Users are prompted to log in to Spotify, and the app retrieves an authorization code, which is then exchanged for an OAuth token.**Playlist Creation**: A private playlist called “Taylor Swift Top 10” is created for the authenticated user.**Fetching Artist’s Top Tracks**: The code fetches Taylor Swift’s top tracks from Spotify, specific to the US market.**Adding Tracks to Playlist**: The tracks are added to the newly created playlist using their Spotify URIs.
**Additional Considerations**
**Exception Handling**: The code includes`try-catch`
blocks to catch exceptions during API calls (e.g., if the authorization fails or a playlist cannot be created).**User Authorization**: The`AuthorizationCodeAuth`
model is used for secure access, allowing the app to modify user playlists after explicit consent.
This setup allows users to create dynamic playlists, personalize music experiences and integrate Spotify seamlessly into applications.

By leveraging an API copilot, this complex series of API interactions is simplified into a structured and executable format. The copilot ensures that the right endpoints, authentication processes and API parameters are handled automatically, making it easier for developers to implement sophisticated features like playlist creation and song management, without manually writing every detail.

**Challenges with AI-Generated SDKs**
While this may sound promising, AI-based SDK generation is far from being a complete solution. Despite its strengths, there are several critical challenges that must be addressed.

**1. Nondeterminism and Hallucinations**
Nondeterminism refers to the inability of AI models to consistently generate the same output for identical inputs. This is especially problematic for SDK generation, where consistency is key. If an SDK generated by an AI assistant differs slightly each time, it can cause significant integration issues down the road. Developers need to trust that the code generated will be consistent and reliable — an area where AI currently falls short.

One related issue is “hallucination,” where AI generates syntactically correct code that does not align with the underlying logic or API documentation. For instance, the AI may misinterpret an API endpoint or create functions that, while appearing functional, are entirely unusable in practice.

This could lead to frustrating debugging sessions, where developers have to sift through lines of faulty AI-generated code to correct hallucinations or inconsistencies.

**2. Input and Output Limitations**
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 operate within strict token limits. These limits restrict the amount of input (e.g., API documentation or OpenAPI specs) and output (e.g., SDK code) that can be processed in a single run. For larger or more complex APIs, this becomes a significant bottleneck. As SDK generation often requires handling large codebases, AI’s current token constraints prevent it from generating complete SDKs in one pass.

**3. Security Concerns**
AI models are trained on vast amounts of existing code, which includes both secure and insecure examples. This makes them prone to generating code that is vulnerable to common security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) or path traversal attacks. For example, a seemingly harmless AI-generated function could have hidden vulnerabilities, such as allowing unauthorized file access, if not properly vetted.

The complexity of modern APIs often involves managing authentication, rate limits and sensitive data, all of which need to be handled securely. Relying solely on AI to generate such code without human oversight can open the door to serious security breaches. Therefore, every piece of AI-generated code must be carefully reviewed and tested by human developers.

**4. State Management and Memory Constraints**
Another challenge with AI-generated SDKs is that LLMs struggle with managing state and context across long interactions. SDK generation often involves multiple steps where memory of the previous state is crucial, such as chaining API calls or tracking authentication states. Without an effective memory mechanism, AI may generate code that does not correctly manage these interactions, resulting in broken workflows.

**Hybrid Approach: Combining AI and Deterministic Code Generation**
Given the limitations outlined above, AI is not yet ready to replace traditional SDK generation methods. However, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of AI and deterministic tools offers a promising solution. While deterministic code generators like APIMatic ensure reliable, repeatable results, AI can enhance flexibility and assist with more dynamic tasks.

**Exploring APIs With AI**: Before diving into the code, developers need to understand the API’s concepts, limits and potential use cases. AI is well-suited for dynamically answering these types of queries, sifting through documentation and providing high-level insights into how the API functions. By leveraging AI’s natural language understanding capabilities, developers can quickly get up to speed on complex APIs without needing to manually parse extensive documentation.**Static Code Generation for API Access**: Once the conceptual phase is over, deterministic code generation tools should take over. These tools are designed to handle the repeatable, reliable generation of API access code, which includes authentication flows, request handling and endpoint communication. Because this part of the workflow requires consistency and security, traditional methods are still the best fit.**Custom Business Logic With AI**: After the static SDK code is in place, AI can again assist developers in building custom business logic that interacts with the API. Developers can leverage AI to generate boilerplate code, quickly scaffold application logic or explore creative solutions tailored to their specific use case. However, every line of AI-generated code in this phase should be carefully reviewed to avoid potential hallucinations and security flaws.
**The Future of AI in SDK Generation**
As AI continues to evolve, its role in SDK generation is expected to grow, though certain challenges remain. For now, combining AI with traditional code generation methods offers a balanced approach to boosting developer productivity without sacrificing reliability or security. However, a significant future development is the integration of workflow-oriented specifications, like [Arazzo](https://spec.openapis.org/arazzo/latest.html), into API design and consumption.

Arazzo, a workflow specification developed under the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI), allows developers to go beyond basic endpoint descriptions and capture the full sequence of API interactions, including state transitions and dependencies. By combining AI-driven tools with specifications like Arazzo, developers can describe and automate complex API workflows more effectively.

This specification can greatly benefit AI’s application in SDK generation, by helping manage multistep workflows that require contextual awareness and state management. For instance, APIs involving multiple authentication steps, payment gateways or user-driven workflows can be better represented through Arazzo. This level of abstraction can aid AI tools in better understanding the flow of API calls and generating more accurate, reliable SDK code.

Moreover, Arazzo’s extensibility allows developers to define custom business logic within their workflows, creating a more comprehensive integration between deterministic code generation and AI-powered assistance. This means that while AI continues to handle dynamic query resolution and initial code scaffolding, tools like Arazzo can guide the generation of more complex, stateful API workflows.

As token limitations expand and AI systems improve their ability to maintain context and memory, future developments could allow AI to handle larger codebases and multistep workflows more efficiently. With enhanced specifications like Arazzo, the accuracy and applicability of AI-generated SDKs will improve, paving the way for a more seamless and reliable development experience.

In summary, the future of AI in SDK generation will likely involve a deeper integration with workflow-driven specifications like Arazzo, enhancing the AI’s capability to handle complex API interactions and stateful operations, while still relying on traditional methods for static code generation and security management.

**Conclusion**
AI is becoming an increasingly valuable tool for developers, especially when it comes to exploring APIs and automating repetitive tasks. However, significant challenges remain, particularly in terms of nondeterminism, hallucination, security risks and the inability to handle large codebases.

While AI can enhance the SDK development process, it is not yet ready to replace traditional methods entirely. The most effective approach today is a hybrid model that leverages AI for its dynamic capabilities and traditional code generators for their reliability.
