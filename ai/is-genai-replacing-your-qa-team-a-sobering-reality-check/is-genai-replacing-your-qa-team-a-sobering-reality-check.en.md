The hype around Generative AI (GenAI) is deafening, especially in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and Quality Assurance (QA). Vendors are promising revolutionary changes, saying AI agents will replace entire teams. But as developers and technical leaders, we need to approach this wave with a healthy dose of pragmatism, focusing on building trust and finding real value — not chasing hype cycles that often end up as expensive shelfware.

Let’s be honest: Despite the amazing demos, GenAI hasn’t *fundamentally* changed core QA processes like test case generation, test data management, bug triage, or script maintenance — at least not yet. Many tools overpromise, struggling with the inherent challenges of LLMs like hallucinations and non-deterministic results. These aren’t minor bugs; they’re showstoppers for reliable regression testing, especially in regulated environments. Anyone claiming their tool can fully replace human testers today is, frankly, selling snake oil.

The latest hype cycle around Agentic AI has set the bubble to new frothy heights, promising ever more functionality, without recognizing that Agents change *nothing* about the fundamental limitations of LLMs. If an LLM is like talking to a toddler who owns an encyclopedia, an AI Agent effectively gives that toddler access to an entire toolshed (including the chainsaw and pitchfork). The buzzword is hypnotic, and the capabilities are cool, but the protocols are so new that there aren’t even basic protections in place around security.

When it comes to integrating [any new technology](https://thenewstack.io/3-benefits-of-technology-integrations-in-cloud-security/), especially one as game-changing as GenAI, trust is key — especially with QA teams, who are inherently skeptical (it’s their job!). Dismissing their concerns or ignoring the limitations of current AI tools will backfire and erode confidence. Instead, be upfront about the risks, the benefits, and the weaknesses. Acknowledge the known issues with LLMs and give your teams the freedom to explore, experiment, and figure out how to work with these powerful yet flawed tools. Give them agency in defining their relationship with AI.

## Building Trust: The Foundation for AI Integration

Building trust also demands strict ethical guidelines. Job number one: DO NOT USE CUSTOMER DATA in queries to cloud-hosted LLMs unless you are specifically cleared to do so by your employer. Customer data is protected by very specific terms and conditions, and the big AI vendors count as third-party sub-processors (which need to be disclosed). The risks of data exposure and inaccurate, hallucinated insights are too high. Generate bespoke test data (perhaps using an LLM guided by a schema) or use thoroughly anonymized data (subject to rigorous review) instead. Publish clear AI usage policies, maintain an approved list of tools and sub-processors, and provide regular training to reinforce responsible practices.

So where can GenAI deliver value *now*? Forget replacing the critical thinking and risk analysis at the heart of QA. Instead, focus on eliminating toil and augmenting human capabilities. My guiding principle has always been: [“Automate the boring stuff first.”](https://thenewstack.io/automate-the-boring-stuff-with-kubernetes/) Think about the tedious tasks that drain focus and introduce context-switching delays: generating project scaffolding, writing boilerplate config, summarizing vast amounts of test results, creating initial drafts of bug reports (with screenshots, videos, and logs), or even helping decipher complex legacy test scripts.

[Vibe coding is real](https://thenewstack.io/vibe-coding-in-a-post-ide-world-why-agentic-ai-is-the-real-disruption/), but at some point, every session I’ve run becomes more about wrangling the crazy things the LLM is doing rather than building your software. For junior developers, this can be a risky proposition: If you don’t know the difference between good code and bad, you won’t be able to review and course-correct the mistakes it makes.

I recently vibe-coded a [Python script to bridge GitLab’s GraphQL API](https://thenewstack.io/getting-started-with-the-deepl-language-translation-api-in-python/) and Snowflake — a task that would have taken days became manageable in hours through iterative prompting and refinement. It can be a fantastic brainstorming partner, helping overcome writer’s block when creating a test plan or forcing more thoughtful consideration of risks. [Developers are finding success](https://thenewstack.io/mindset-refactor-evolving-for-developer-success/) using GenAI for generating unit, component, and API tests — areas where tests are typically more deterministic and self-contained. Agentic AI could theoretically create and execute these scripts for me, without [needing to know how they work](https://thenewstack.io/vector-databases-what-devs-need-to-know-about-how-they-work/). I’m not willing to put quite that much trust in these tools yet.

But that project was a one-off script, not software that needs to be maintained over time. In order to vibe-code test automation projects, you need to ensure that you understand the limitations and strengths of the LLM you’re using, and that you make periodic commits in case things go haywire. Test [automation code tends to require](https://thenewstack.io/platform-teams-automate-infrastructure-requirement-gathering/) abstraction and careful planning for low-maintenance scripts. Vibe-coding still isn’t quite up to the task of doing this level of work for you — it’s much better for one-offs.

This “augmentation, not automation” approach changes how we incorporate the tools: instead of asking AI to be the tester, ask it to:

* Analyze test results and pinpoint why a test failed (UI change? API error? Performance lag?)
* Help optimize test execution strategy based on risk and past results.
* Identify test coverage gaps and overlaps.
* Facilitate better cross-team communication, perhaps through [API Contract Testing](https://thenewstack.io/reining-in-the-api-wild-west-5-api-testing-best-practices/) to catch breaking changes early, supporting collaboration instead of blame.

## The True ROI of Generative AI in Quality Assurance

The true ROI of GenAI in QA likely won’t come from headcount reduction, despite what some managers might hope or vendors might promise. It will come from enabling teams to deliver higher-quality software faster by removing drudgery, providing better insights, and freeing up human experts to focus on complex problem-solving and strategic risk management.

The GenAI landscape is immature, especially regarding its integration into the SDLC. Many tools will fall short. Be prepared to evaluate critically and discard tools that don’t deliver sustained value beyond the initial demo. Be aware of vendor lock-in, and look for tools that follow standards (MCP for Agents, A2A for ecosystem). Prefer open source if possible. Don’t let the rush to adopt AI cause you to undervalue the irreplaceable craft of QA.

By embracing GenAI’s limitations as readily as its capabilities, focusing on trust, and targeting the right problems — the toil, the tedious, the time-consuming — we can leverage its capabilities to truly enhance, not just disrupt, how we build and deliver software.
