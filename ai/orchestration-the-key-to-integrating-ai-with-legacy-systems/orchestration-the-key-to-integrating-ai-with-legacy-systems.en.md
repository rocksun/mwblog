In today’s enterprise landscape, AI may dominate the conversation, but legacy systems still underpin mission-critical operations for many — if not most — businesses.

At the same time, organizations are investing heavily in AI to automate more. However, many of these AI capabilities end up layered on systems never designed to support them, creating a patchwork of disconnected tools. It’s no surprise that, according to the [NANDA project](https://thenewstack.io/how-mits-project-nanda-aims-to-decentralize-ai-agents/) at MIT, [only 5%](https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf) of AI pilots move into production with measurable value.

The challenge isn’t the [age of legacy software](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-in-legacy-systems-the-problem-no-one-talks-about/) or the pace of AI developments. The real obstacle is the [lack of orchestration](https://thenewstack.io/how-mcp-and-ai-are-modernizing-legacy-systems/), the connective layer required to [make old and new systems operate as one](https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-can-speed-up-modernization-of-your-legacy-it-systems/).

## **The Modernization Conundrum**

Digital transformation efforts often collapse under their own complexity. Businesses rush to deploy AI while continuing to rely on rigid [systems that operate in siloes](https://thenewstack.io/why-most-apis-fail-in-ai-systems-and-how-to-fix-it/). However, AI requires a robust structure, real-time data and a 360-degree view of operations to deliver meaningful outcomes.

When these environments fail to align, cracks begin to show. AI becomes another isolated tool, process handoffs break down and what should be automated ends up requiring manual intervention. Instead of reducing compliance risk and complexity, organizations unintentionally compound both issues and add to their technical debt.

The path forward requires integrating AI and existing legacy platforms into cohesive, end-to-end processes.

## **Why Orchestration Matters**

Business automation relies on a coordinated series of tasks executed across people, legacy applications, AI capabilities and other systems. Orchestration provides the structure that ensures each step transitions smoothly to the next.

By synchronizing work across every endpoint, orchestration creates a shared logic. AI becomes a value-adding participant in broader workflows rather than an isolated engine. Legacy systems continue powering mission-critical operations, but now with the added benefit of AI-driven support. This unified approach gives teams the visibility, flexibility and governance needed to maintain quality and control.

When an orchestration layer is in place, AI evolves from a workaround to a natural extension of legacy logic. As a result, organizations can modernize in a way that’s manageable, safe and low-risk.

## **Choosing the Right Orchestration Model**

Not every process calls for the same orchestration strategy and that’s how many leaders fall at the first hurdle.

Some environments demand predictability and strict control. Deterministic orchestration is ideal here: processes follow predefined rules, conditions and decision models. The process becomes fully auditable, making it well-suited for highly regulated industries and stable, repeatable tasks.

In contrast, dynamic orchestration allows AI agents to manage processes in a non-deterministic way. Instead of following a preset path, agents evaluate context in real-time to determine the next action. While such flexibility can increase efficiency, it also increases variability and requires strong guardrails to avoid unexpected or uncontrolled outcomes.

Ultimately, most organizations need a blend of the two. [Agentic orchestration combines the reliability](https://thenewstack.io/avoiding-the-ai-agent-reliability-tax-a-developers-guide/) of deterministic processes with the adaptive decision-making of AI agents. Agents operate within defined parameters but still have room to handle specific subprocesses, resolve exceptions and react to live context.

## **Actionable Advice for Leaders**

Orchestration must be treated as a strategic discipline, and these five practical steps provide a roadmap for adopting it successfully:

1. **Start with the process, not the technology.** Before introducing AI, map the underlying process to understand where rules are fixed and where decisions shift based on context.
2. **Put guardrails around innovation.** Use orchestration to enforce policies, thresholds and escalation paths so AI operates with clarity, consistency and compliance.
3. **Resolve the handoff problem.** Ensure continuity between people, legacy systems, AI tools and other systems by using orchestration as the connective layer.
4. **Make every decision traceable.** Adopt technologies that offer full visibility into AI-driven actions, revealing what happened, why and under what conditions.
5. **Pilot small, scale smart.** Test agentic orchestration within a contained sub-process before expanding it across end-to-end business processes.

## **Maintaining Governance and Compliance**

A common myth is that AI-driven automation cannot be governed effectively. In reality, strong governance depends on visibility, and on organizations understanding how AI operates within their processes.

To achieve this, organizations must model processes visually and apply real-time monitoring to track AI outputs and their impact on how their business operates. This transparency is essential to meet evolving regulatory expectations, particularly in highly regulated sectors.

Orchestration provides the clarity teams [need to know when human oversight](https://thenewstack.io/github-ceo-on-why-well-still-need-human-programmers/) or manual approvals are necessary. This awareness maintains accountability, reduces risk and ensures compliance without slowing innovation.

## **Amplifying Legacy Systems with AI**

AI doesn’t need to replace legacy systems to deliver meaningful impact, but they do need to interact seamlessly, consistently and under full governance. Through orchestration, organizations can connect people, legacy platforms and AI tools into a continuous, end-to-end process.

This approach mitigates risk, simplifies modernization, and creates a flexible architecture capable of supporting future technologies and evolving business demands.

The goal isn’t to start over. It’s to make existing systems smarter, faster and future-ready.
