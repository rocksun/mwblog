AI captured our imagination in 2024. But what is AI actually doing for you and your team in 2025? If the answer is nothing, take a look at this list of tools curated for DevOps and SREs.

This isnât just a list of all of the big names who carelessly slap âAIâ on top of their platform. These are tools that are actually reimagining what DevOps and SRE should look like.

**1. Incident Management**
Sure, PagerDuty works, but donât you want a tool that does more than just page you? Each of these tools for incident management is designed to help your teams respond to incidents via their incident management platform with AI-driven automation for incident workflows, postmortems, and more.

**2. Incident Response**
: Parity is the AI SRE for incident response. It leverages AI to investigate incidents alongside your on-call engineers, speeding up MTTR and making the life of on-call engineers easier.**Parity**
**3. Observability & Monitoring**
: Mezmo is a log ingestion and aggregation tool that uses ML to correlate and de-duplicate logs. With the explosion in observability data, having a tool that is able to make that data useful and actionable to teams is key.**Mezmo**: Causely takes a unique approach of using a causal model to attempt to turn observability data and alerts into specific root causes.**Causely**

**4. Cost Optimization**
: Kubecost provides intelligent insights into cloud spend and automated alerting.**Kubecost**: Cast.ai optimizes cloud costs by right-sizing your workloads and automating resource scaling, ensuring you only pay for what you need.**Cast.ai**
**5. Software Delivery (CI/CD)**
: Harness is well known as a comprehensive CI/CD platform and has recently made the push to layer in AI through DevOps, QA, and code assistants natively connected to their platform.**Harness**
**6. Developer Tools and Miscellaneous**
: Bring the power of LLMs directly into your Kubernetes cluster with k8sGPT. For anyone using Kubernetes for the first time, k8sGPT makes it significantly more approachable. And itâs open source!**k8sGPT**: If you havenât started using Cursor, youâre missing out. This AI-powered IDE makes leveraging LLMs in your coding workflow so easy.**Cursor**: This is the only non-technical tool on this list, but it has been one of the most useful tools weâve used internally! I tried several notetakers and was always disappointed with how much of the summary was just useless AI-generated fluff. Circleback seems to have somehow solved this.**Circleback**
## Conclusion
AI is changing the way we think about DevOps and SRE, not by taking over, but by making our lives a little easier. These tools arenât just buzzwordsâthey actually help you work smarter, whether itâs automating your incident response, making sense of mountains of logs, or even cutting down on cloud costs. If youâre not using AI tools yet, give a few of these a shot and see how they fit into your workflow. Who knows? You might wonder how you ever worked without them.
