The holiday season is upon us and so are change freezes. The engineering tradition to pause deployments during this wonderful, yet understaffed, time of the year can reduce service disruption, even as digital traffic spikes.

But incidents can still happen.

One thing that catches many engineers off guard during change freezes is that services that typically get deployed every day or so can suddenly reveal new failure modes when left running for weeks. This makes intelligent monitoring and rapid response even more critical during the holidays.

Here’s the good news: AI can help filter out the noise, detect anomalies sooner and take faster and smarter action, making it easier to go through yet another on-call holiday.

Here are three ways AI can [help engineering teams better prepare](https://thenewstack.io/what-can-incident-teams-learn-from-crisis-management/) for the holiday season.

### 1. Focused Action With Embedded AI

At a time when team capacity is much more limited, it’s critical to determine which issues truly require attention. But even in a freeze, responder teams can get pelted with noisy alerts across their tools. AI can significantly reduce alert noise, improve incident visibility and remove manual, repetitive work.

When embedded in incident management workflows, AI can turn signals into intelligent action:

* Machine learning (ML) intelligently suppresses and groups alerts so only meaningful issues are flagged.
* Alerts can be enriched with service-related data and key metrics/logs, eliminating guesswork about the issue, its impact and who should handle it.
* [Event-driven automation can automatically route incidents](https://thenewstack.io/fighting-incidents-with-end-to-end-event-driven-automation/) to the right team and trigger diagnostics even before human intervention.

Fewer, richer and better-routed incidents mean less alert fatigue and faster acknowledgment, which is especially critical when teams want to actually disconnect and spend time with loved ones, not answer calls at odd hours.

But when incidents do occur, having the right context immediately available becomes crucial, especially for responders returning from time off.

### 2. Accelerating Triage and Capturing What Works

Picture this: A responder who just got back from PTO suddenly gets pinged. Instead of scrambling through chat threads, dashboards and logs to piece together what’s happening, an AI agent can gather relevant context before the responder even starts working on the issue, accelerating response.

Let’s see how the AI agent can work:

Working side-by-side with AI agents, teams grow stronger with every incident. Responders spend less time getting caught up and more time solving problems, building more resilient operations that will require less heroics next holiday season.

### 3. Smarter Decision-Making and Communications

When an issue occurs during a change freeze, timely communication and transparent collaboration play an even bigger part in efficient incident management. However, teams struggle to resolve incidents while, at the same time, satisfying the communication requirements with stakeholders and responders. This drives up mean time to repair (MTTR) and frustrates responders who feel pulled in two different, yet equally important, directions.

Generative and agentic AI can [automate these processes](https://thenewstack.io/five-ways-process-automation-can-streamline-itops/) to give responders a break from the information digging and drafting so they can focus on resolution. Here are some examples of this in action:

* AI can proactively summarize the status of an incident to easily get teams up to speed within the chat.
* A scribe agent can automatically transcribe incident calls and combine it with chat history to capture key decisions and next steps.
* AI maintains an automated, consistent record of all actions taken during the incident, enabling teams to quickly generate status updates while making post-incident reviews more about extracting insights, not reconstructing events.

Teams can get a shared [incident picture in minutes without compromising a responder’s focus](https://thenewstack.io/fast-focused-incident-response-reduce-system-noise-by-98/) or a stakeholder’s need to stay informed.

## Make AI Your On-Call Holiday Gift

Incidents never take a holiday, but AI can shoulder much of the cognitive load that makes on-call duty especially draining during this season. These three plays give your skeleton crew the efficiency they need to operate as a full team. Less time hunting for context, fewer 3 a.m. alerts, faster resolution and responders who can actually enjoy their time off knowing they’ll have the support they need when called back.
