In the not-so-distant past, search was relatively simple: A search engine would find and rank content that matched the keywords or phrases of a query. But this traditional model of lexical search has been shattered by the emergence of [large language models (LLMs)](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-llms).

Today, semantic, generative AI (GenAI) and agent-based approaches are reshaping industry practices by allowing people to ask complex questions using natural language. However, these approaches still struggle with issues like [the accuracy of results and hallucinations](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agentic-evaluation-tools-help-devs-fight-hallucinations/), citation quality, and the freshness of information.

GenAI is also altering the technologies underlying search. This is especially true for databases, as the traditional relational databases that have long powered search aren’t well equipped to handle new approaches like [retrieval augmented generation (RAG)](https://thenewstack.io/no-mcp-hasnt-killed-rag-in-fact-theyre-complementary).

## The New Role of Vector Databases in Search

Now vector databases are taking the lead, enabling trustworthy, intent-driven retrieval and powering reliable AI agents. These capabilities help ensure accuracy, adaptability and seamless integration with modern AI frameworks.

If you’re struggling with trust and accuracy problems in AI-based search, **join us on Nov. 4 at 11 a.m. PT | 2 p.m. ET for a special online event, [Achieving Relevant AI with Vector Search](https://thenewstack.io/webinar/achieving-relevant-ai-with-vector-search/).**

During this free webinar, Dave Moore, principal solutions architect at Elastic, and TNS Host Chris Pirillo will discuss the critical role of vector databases in enabling trustworthy, intent-driven retrieval and powering reliable AI agents.
