The concepts of choice and accessibility play pivotal roles in maximizing the impact of
[artificial intelligence](https://thenewstack.io/ai/).
In the world of AI, cloud has been the traditional powerhouse. It has provided the heavy lifting for complex computations and vast
[data needs required to train models](https://thenewstack.io/machine-learning-for-real-time-data-analysis-training-models-in-production/) and sustain the extreme compute requirements for inference in deployment at scale.
But as AI scales and spreads, latency, privacy concerns, connectivity and network bandwidth constraints limit the full impact AI can have. AI at the edge offsets some of these limitations, especially for applications requiring immediate data processing, with strict latency constraints and availability requirements. It also addresses privacy and
[security concerns head-on by keeping sensitive data](https://thenewstack.io/qa-how-verticalchange-secures-sensitive-data-using-open-source-tools/) localized.
This shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. It’s reminiscent of the early cloud days, when hosting data and applications remotely offered efficiency gains in terms of cost, performance and the ability to get products to market faster. In those days, the decision was not binary; it was a hybrid combination that offered the flexibility necessary for any organization and project.
The move from mostly cloud-based GenAI to edge-plus-cloud options resembles the evolution of web applications. The web began as predominantly server-based, with “dumb” browsers that mostly interfaced with the user, but as they evolved, they gradually absorbed both application logic and UI.
This transition to edge computing in AI, akin to the web’s transition toward sophisticated browsers that resemble operating systems, addresses these limitations, and offers the flexibility necessary for diverse AI applications and projects.
**Living on the Edge** [Edge deployments in AI applications](https://thenewstack.io/tutorial-configure-deploy-an-edge-application-on-cloud-native-edge-infrastructure/) offer a multitude of benefits that are reshaping the technology landscape.
One of the most significant is “always-on availability.” Deploying AI models locally eliminates dependence on external network connections or remote servers, minimizing the risk of downtime caused by maintenance, outages or connectivity issues. This level of resilience is particularly critical in sectors like healthcare and other sensitive industries where uninterrupted service is absolutely critical.
Edge deployments also ensure “low latency,” as the speed of light is a fundamental limiting factor, and there may be significant latency when accessing cloud infrastructure. With increasingly powerful hardware available at the edge, it enables the processing of data that is physically nearby.
Another benefit is the ability to harness specialized hardware that is tailored to their needs, optimizing performance and efficiency while bypassing network latency and bandwidth limitations, as well as configuration constraints imposed by cloud providers.
Lastly, edge deployments allow for the centralization of large shared assets within a secure environment, which in turn simplifies storage management and access control, enhancing data security and governance.
**Get Your Head in the Cloud**
While edge deployments offer compelling properties in AI applications, so do cloud-based deployments.
For example,
[the cloud offers a lot more compute power](https://thenewstack.io/are-isps-better-bets-to-offer-cloud-computing-for-the-edge/). Cloud environments often provide vast computing resources, making them ideal for tasks that demand extensive computational power. Complex simulations, large-scale data processing and high-performance computing are areas where the cloud excels.
The
[cloud offers broad access to online data sources](https://thenewstack.io/open-source-and-the-cloud-native-data-center/). Cloud solutions facilitate access to a wealth of online data sources and services. This can prove invaluable when AI models require real-time data updates or access to extensive datasets that are hosted in the cloud.
Cloud environments are also well-suited for continuous model training. They can efficiently manage and distribute the training process across distributed resources, ensuring that AI models are always up to date with the latest data.
The edge is not a panacea on its own. Cloud computing plays a vital role, especially in handling tasks that require massive computational power and historical data analysis.
**Edge + Cloud = The Democratization of AI**
The synergy between edge and cloud solutions is undeniable, creating a hybrid ecosystem that maximizes the potential of AI applications while addressing their unique requirements. It combines the low latency, data privacy, and customization benefits of edge deployments with the scalability and extensive resources of
[cloud computing](https://thenewstack.io/emerging-edge-cloud-and-computing-infrastructure/), offering a well-rounded solution for diverse AI scenarios.
By distributing tasks between edge and cloud, we can optimize AI applications for speed, efficiency, security and privacy.
But it’s much bigger than that — the edge-plus-cloud approach democratizes AI, allowing it to function effectively even in remote areas with limited internet connectivity. This solution may open up unprecedented opportunities for AI-driven advancements in underdeveloped regions, bridging the digital divide that threatens to leave many behind in the AI revolution.
