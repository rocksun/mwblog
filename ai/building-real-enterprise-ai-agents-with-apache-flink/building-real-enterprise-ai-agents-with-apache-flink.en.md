The current focus on AI chatbots overlooks the real opportunity for businesses: building autonomous agents. We want AI systems that don’t merely tell a customer their shipment is delayed, but one that can prevent the delay in the first place. This requires a system that is always on, embedded deep within your infrastructure and capable of monitoring the constant stream of events that defines the state of your business.

This is the true promise of enterprise AI: not a chatbot that waits for a question, but a fleet of agents that constantly watches, understands and reacts. An agent that detects a fraudulent pattern and freezes an account before the money is gone. An agent that sees a surge in user activity and proactively scales a service.

However, this vision exposes a fundamental architectural gap.

You cannot build these always-on, state-aware systems using the stateless, request-response models designed for chatbots. They require an architecture built from the ground up to process continuous event streams and manage evolving state.

Let’s explore that architecture. We will make the case for stateful stream processing as the necessary foundation for this new class of AI and demonstrate how [Apache Flink](https://thenewstack.io/a-developers-guide-to-getting-started-with-apache-flink/) provides the robust, low-latency engine required to bring these autonomous agents to life.

## AI Agent Hype Hits a Wall: The Infrastructure Bottleneck

The vision for autonomous AI agents is compelling.

We imagine them intelligently automating everything from supply chain logistics to real-time customer personalization. While large language models (LLMs) have become incredibly powerful, a major obstacle prevents this vision from becoming a widespread reality. The problem isn’t the agent’s brain; it’s the plumbing.

To make decisions, an agent needs access to fresh, contextual data from across the business. The common approach today is to stitch together a patchwork of disconnected systems: one for data streaming (like [Apache Kafka](https://thenewstack.io/what-devs-should-know-when-starting-an-apache-kafka-journey/)), another for workflow orchestration, one for aggregating all the possible contextual data the agent might need and a separate application runtime for the agent’s logic.

This “stitching” approach creates a system that is both operationally complex and technically fragile. Engineers are left managing a brittle architecture where data is handed off between systems, introducing significant latency at each step. This process often relies on polling or micro-batching, meaning the agent is always acting on slightly stale data. Furthermore, when something goes wrong, debugging is a nightmare because there is no unified view or observability across the entire workflow.

This reveals a clear gap in today’s technology stack: the absence of a unified, native framework for building, running and scaling agents directly on the real-time data streams they need to be effective.

## A New Worldview: Agents as Event-Driven Microservices

To overcome the infrastructure bottleneck, we need to fundamentally change the way we think about agent architecture. Instead of treating agents as request-response applications that we bolt onto our systems, we should build them as event-driven [microservices](https://thenewstack.io/microservices/).

This paradigm can be broken down into a simple formula: An agent is the combination of event-driven logic, which triggers its operation; fresh, contextual data, which informs its decisions; and an LLM reasoning engine, which powers its intelligence. Viewing agents through this lens reveals why a streaming architecture isn’t just a choice, but a necessity.

This model provides three critical advantages:

1. **Agents require fresh, contextual data:** An agent is only as good as the data it has access to. For an agent to detect fraud or predict a stock outage, it needs a live, accurate view of business events as they happen. A streaming architecture provides a natural pipeline to capture, process and enrich data in motion. This ensures that when an agent needs to make a decision, the precise context it requires is available instantly, free from the latency and staleness of traditional data polling.
2. **Business processes are asynchronous and continuous:** Most critical business workflows don’t fit neatly into a synchronous, request-response model. Processing an insurance claim, managing inventory levels or tracking a shipment are continuous, stateful processes that can unfold over hours or days. A stream processing model is designed for exactly this reality, allowing agents to operate asynchronously and maintain context over long periods, just like the business processes they are automating.
3. **Replayability is a developmental superpower:** This is the most powerful, yet subtle, advantage of an event-driven approach. When an agent’s inputs are simply events from a durable, ordered log (like Apache Kafka), it unlocks a revolutionary development life cycle:
   * **Develop and test safely:** You can replay a stream of real historical events to safely test and iterate on your agent’s logic. This allows for rigorous, realistic testing without any risk or side effects on live production systems.
   * **Enable “dark launches”:** Before deploying a new version of an agent, you can run it in the background on the live event stream. This allows you to compare its decisions and outputs with the current production version, ensuring it behaves as expected before you make the switch.
   * **Unify batch and stream processing:** The line between historical and real-time data disappears. You can treat a log of past events as a “batch” to develop and train your agent, and then deploy the exact same code to operate on the live “stream.” This eliminates the need for separate codebases and guarantees consistency between testing and production.

## The Engine for Event-Driven Agents: Apache Flink

This event-driven worldview requires a new kind of infrastructure, an engine built for continuous computation on unbounded streams of data. This is where Apache Flink comes in. Flink is an open source stream processing framework designed from the ground up for stateful computations, making it the ideal foundation for building autonomous agents.

Out of the box, Flink provides the core capabilities that are essential for reliable agentic systems:

* **Stateful computation:** Flink can remember information and context from past events. This gives an agent a persistent “memory” to understand sequences, patterns and user histories without relying on an external database for every lookup.
* **Low-latency, high-throughput processing:** It is designed to process massive volumes of events, millions per second, with millisecond latency, enabling agents to react to business events the moment they occur.
* **Fault tolerance with exactly-once semantics:** This is critical for building autonomous systems you can trust. Flink guarantees that even if a machine in the cluster fails, each event will be processed correctly exactly one time. This ensures the agent’s state remains consistent and free of duplicated or lost information.

While Flink provides the perfect engine, the community recognized the need for better native support for agent-specific workflows. This led to [Streaming Agents](https://www.confluent.io/product/streaming-agents/), designed to make Flink the definitive platform for building agents. Crucially, this is not another tool to stitch into your stack. It’s a native framework that directly extends Flink’s own DataStream and Table APIs, making agent development a first-class citizen within the Flink ecosystem.

This native approach unlocks the most powerful benefit: the seamless integration of data processing and AI. Before, an engineer might have one Flink job to enrich data, which then writes to a message queue for a separate Python service to apply the AI logic. With [Streaming Agents](https://thenewstack.io/confluents-real-time-agents-build-on-kafka-streaming-data/), complex data transformations, like joining event streams, aggregating data into features and enriching it with context, can happen within the same unified pipeline as the agent’s reasoning and decision-making logic.

This eliminates the inefficient and error-prone boundary between the “data world” and the “AI world,” creating a single, observable and end-to-end consistent system.

## Streaming Agents in the Real World: Automating Processes

The true power of Streaming Agents is unlocked when they move beyond simple data transformation and into the realm of “closed-world” automation. This involves automating specific, high-volume business processes where the agent operates on a defined set of data streams, tools and objectives.

### Use Case 1: Insurance Claim Processing

In insurance, claim processing is a core function ripe for automation. A Streaming Agent can be designed to continuously monitor a stream of incoming claims. When a new claim event is ingested, the agent autonomously gathers the necessary context by querying the policyholder’s details, their claims history and associated damage reports from various internal databases and object stores.

Using an LLM, it performs critical checks for fraud indicators, policy compliance and data completeness. Based on its analysis, the agent then intelligently routes the claim to the next step: auto-approving low-risk claims, flagging complex cases for human review or requesting more information from the customer, dramatically accelerating resolution times.

### Use Case 2: Proactive Supply Chain Management

Modern supply chains generate a torrent of real-time data. A Streaming Agent can be deployed to constantly monitor multiple streams of logistics data, including shipment locations from carriers, current warehouse inventory levels and external weather alerts.

The agent’s goal is to proactively detect potential disruptions. When its analysis of the combined data streams reveals a likely delay, for instance, a stalled shipment heading to a warehouse with low stock of that item, it autonomously plans and triggers a corrective action. This could involve rerouting a different shipment, splitting an order or creating a stock transfer order, all while simultaneously notifying stakeholders of the disruption and the solution.

### Use Case 3: Intelligent Catalog Maintenance

For online marketplaces and e-commerce platforms like Instacart, maintaining a clean, consistent product catalog is a massive operational challenge. A Streaming Agent can automate this process by ingesting streams of product data from hundreds or thousands of partners.

As the varied data arrives, the agent uses an LLM to understand and standardize it, normalizing descriptions ( e.g., “12 oz” vs. “a dozen ounces”), enriching product attributes and assigning them to the correct categories. It can also identify inconsistencies like mismatched pricing or missing images, automatically flagging them for review or, in clear-cut cases, updating the central product catalog directly, ensuring a high-quality customer experience.

## The Future: Every Engineer Is an AI Engineer

The goal of Streaming Agents is to democratize development, empowering millions of developers worldwide to build intelligent applications. By providing familiar APIs and abstractions, we bring AI development into the mainstream software engineering life cycle, allowing every engineer to leverage these powerful new capabilities.

However, agents will only succeed if they are built like robust, production-grade software, not brittle demos. This is where Flink provides the critical foundation.

It treats the essential components of real-world applications, state management, observability and fault-tolerant reliability as first-class citizens. This ensures that the agents you build are not just intelligent, but also scalable, resilient and ready for the demands of production.

Flink provides the essential infrastructure to turn agentic AI from a promising concept into scalable, production systems that drive real business value. The future is being built on data streams, and with Streaming Agents, every developer can have a hand in building it.
