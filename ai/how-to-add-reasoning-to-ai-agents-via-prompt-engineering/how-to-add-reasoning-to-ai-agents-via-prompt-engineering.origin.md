In our previous exploration of [AI agent architecture](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-a-comprehensive-introduction-for-developers/), we discussed the core components of [persona](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-define-an-ai-agent-persona-by-tweaking-llm-prompts/), [instructions and memory](https://thenewstack.io/enhancing-ai-agents-adding-instructions-tasks-and-memory/). Now, we’ll delve into how **different prompting strategies** enhance an agent’s reasoning capabilities, making them more methodical and transparent in their problem-solving approach.

Effective [prompt engineering](https://thenewstack.io/prompt-engineering-get-llms-to-generate-the-content-you-want/) techniques have proven crucial in helping [Large Language Models](https://thenewstack.io/llm/) (LLMs) produce more reliable, structured, and well-reasoned responses. These techniques leverage several key principles:

**Step-by-Step Decomposition:**Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps helps LLMs process information more systematically, reducing errors and improving logical consistency.**Explicit Format Instructions:**Providing clear output structures guides the model to organize its thoughts and present information in a more digestible format.**Self-Reflection Prompts:**Encouraging the model to review its own reasoning process helps catch potential errors and consider alternative perspectives.**Contextual Frameworks:**Offering specific frameworks (like “analyze pros and cons” or “consider multiple scenarios”) helps the model approach problems from different angles.
These techniques form the foundation for our implemented reasoning strategies, each designed to capitalize on different aspects of LLM capabilities while maintaining consistency and reliability in responses.

## Understanding Strategy-Based Reasoning
While basic agents can process tasks directly, advanced reasoning requires structured approaches to problem-solving. The implementation uses a strategy pattern that defines different reasoning frameworks. Let’s look at how these strategies are defined in our enhanced agent architecture:

12345678910 |
class ExecutionStrategy(ABC): @abstractmethod def build_prompt(self, task: str, instruction: Optional[str] = None) -> str: """Build the prompt according to the strategy.""" pass @abstractmethod def process_response(self, response: str) -> str: """Process the LLM response according to the strategy.""" pass |
This abstract base class provides the foundation for implementing various reasoning strategies. Each strategy offers a unique approach to:
- Structuring the problem-solving process;
- Breaking down complex tasks;
- Organizing the agent’s thought process; and
- Ensuring thorough consideration of the problem.
Let’s take a closer look at three different techniques: ReAct, Chain of Thought, and Reflection. The framework makes it easy to add other techniques, too.

## ReAct: Reasoning and Acting
The ReAct strategy (**Re**asoning and **Act**ion) implements a cycle of thought, action, and observation, making the agent’s decision-making process explicit and traceable. Here’s how it’s implemented:

12345678910111213141516 |
class ReactStrategy(ExecutionStrategy): def build_prompt(self, task: str, instruction: Optional[str] = None) -> str: base_prompt = """Approach this task using the following steps:1) Thought: Analyze what needs to be done2) Action: Decide on the next action3) Observation: Observe the result4) Repeat until task is completeFollow this format for your response:Thought: [Your reasoning about the current situation]Action: [The action you decide to take]Observation: [What you observe after the action]... (continue steps as needed)Final Answer: [Your final response to the task]Task: {task}""" |
This strategy ensures that:
**Explicit Reasoning:**Each step of the thought process is clearly articulated.**Action-Based Approach:**Decisions are tied to concrete actions.**Iterative Refinement:**Solutions evolve through multiple cycles of observation and adjustment.
## Chain of Thought: Step-by-Step Problem Solving
The Chain of Thought strategy breaks down complex problems into manageable steps, making the reasoning process more transparent and verifiable. Here’s what it looks like:

123456789101112 |
class ChainOfThoughtStrategy(ExecutionStrategy): def build_prompt(self, task: str, instruction: Optional[str] = None) -> str: base_prompt = """Let's solve this step by step:Task: {task}Please break down your thinking into clear steps:1) First, ...2) Then, ...(continue with your step-by-step reasoning)Final Answer: [Your conclusion based on the above reasoning]""" |
This approach provides:
- Linear progression through complex problems;
- Clear connection between steps and conclusions;
- Easier verification of the reasoning process; and
- Better understanding of how conclusions are reached.
## Reflection: Deep Analysis and Self-Review
The Reflection strategy adds a meta-cognitive layer, encouraging the agent to examine its own assumptions and consider alternative approaches. In code:

1234567891011121314151617 |
class ReflectionStrategy(ExecutionStrategy): def build_prompt(self, task: str, instruction: Optional[str] = None) -> str: base_prompt = """Complete this task using reflection:Task: {task}1) Initial Approach: - What is your first impression of how to solve this? - What assumptions are you making?2) Analysis: - What could go wrong with your initial approach? - What alternative approaches could you consider?3) Refined Solution: - Based on your reflection, what is the best approach? - Why is this approach better than the alternatives?""" |
## Integration With Agent Architecture
These strategies are seamlessly integrated into the agent architecture through a factory pattern and strategy setter:

123456789 |
class Agent: @property def strategy(self) -> Optional[ExecutionStrategy]: return self._strategy @strategy.setter def strategy(self, strategy_name: str): """Set the execution strategy by name.""" self._strategy = StrategyFactory.create_strategy(strategy_name) |
The execution flow incorporates the selected strategy:
1234567891011121314151617 |
def execute(self, task: Optional[str] = None) -> str: if task is not None: self._task = task messages = self._build_messages() try: response = client.chat.completions.create( model=self._model, messages=messages ) response_content = response.choices[0].message.content # Process response through strategy if set if self._strategy: response_content = self._strategy.process_response(response_content) |
## Practical Implementation
Here’s how these strategies are used in practice:

from agent import Agentdef main(): # Initialize the agent agent = Agent("Problem Solver") # Configure the agent agent.persona = """You are an analytical problem-solving assistant.You excel at breaking down complex problems and explaining your thought process.You are thorough, logical, and clear in your explanations.""" agent.instruction = "Ensure your responses are clear, detailed, and well-structured." # Define the park planning task park_planning_task = """ A city is planning to build a new park. They have the following constraints: - Budget: $2 million - Space: 5 acres - Must include: playground, walking trails, and parking - Environmental concerns: preserve existing trees - Community request: include area for community events How should they approach this project?""" # Display available reasoning strategies print("Available reasoning strategies:", agent.available_strategies()) print("\n" + "="*50) # Test ReAct strategy print("\n=== Using ReAct Strategy ===") agent.strategy = "ReactStrategy" agent.task = park_planning_task response = agent.execute() print(f"\nTask: {park_planning_task}") print("\nResponse:") print(response) print("\n" + "="*50) # Test Chain of Thought strategy print("\n=== Using Chain of Thought Strategy ===") agent.clear_history() # Clear previous interaction history agent.strategy = "ChainOfThoughtStrategy" agent.task = park_planning_task response = agent.execute() print(f"\nTask: {park_planning_task}") print("\nResponse:") print(response) print("\n" + "="*50) # Test Reflection strategy print("\n=== Using Reflection Strategy ===") agent.clear_history() # Clear previous interaction history agent.strategy = "ReflectionStrategy" agent.task = park_planning_task response = agent.execute() print(f"\nTask: {park_planning_task}") print("\nResponse:") print(response) print("\n" + "="*50)if __name__ == "__main__": main() |
This implementation allows for:
**Flexible Strategy Selection:**Different reasoning approaches for different types of tasks.**Consistent Format:**Structured output regardless of the chosen strategy.**Clear Reasoning Trail:**Transparent documentation of the problem-solving process.**Strategy Comparison:**Easy evaluation of different approaches to the same problem.
## Benefits of Strategic Reasoning
The implementation of these reasoning strategies brings several key advantages:

**Enhanced Problem-Solving:**Multiple approaches to tackle complex tasks.**Improved Transparency:**Clear visibility into the agent’s reasoning process.**Better Verification:**Easier validation of the agent’s conclusions.**Flexible Architecture:**Easy addition of new reasoning strategies.
The entire source code for the framework is available in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/janakiramm/agent-framework).

## Looking Ahead
While these reasoning strategies significantly enhance the agent’s capabilities, there are several areas for future improvement:

- Dynamic strategy selection based on task type;
- Hybrid approaches combining multiple strategies;
- Enhanced error handling within each strategy; and
- Metric-based evaluation of strategy effectiveness.
The combination of structured reasoning strategies with the agent’s existing capabilities creates a more powerful and versatile system capable of handling complex problems while maintaining transparency and reliability in its decision-making process.

In the next part of this series, we will add long-term memory to agents that enable them to pause and resume tasks. Stay tuned.
