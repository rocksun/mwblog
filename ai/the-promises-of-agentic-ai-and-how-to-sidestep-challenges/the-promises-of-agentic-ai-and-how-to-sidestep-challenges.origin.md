In boardrooms worldwide, top decision-makers are likely asking their IT executives, “What more can we do with AI?” It’s a reasonable question as artificial intelligence investments continue to skyrocket. According to [recent projections](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1474143/global-ai-market-size), the global AI market is expected to reach more than 800 billion dollars by 2030.

The truth is that AI is set to permeate most aspects of everyday life. We’re already using it in hospitals to help with diagnosis, in coding to streamline product development, and even in industrial settings to improve supply chains. In 2025, the [next evolution of AI will come](https://thenewstack.io/if-computer-science-is-doomed-what-comes-next/) in the form of AI agents. This latest evolution of AI might even bring about the return on investment (ROI) that many [stakeholders are desperately seeking](https://www.cio.com/article/2112589/wheres-the-roi-for-ai-cios-struggle-to-find-it.html). However, there are some steps that enterprises must take to realize the promises of agentic AI and avoid potential perils.

**What Is Agentic AI?**
Let’s first take a moment to [understand what I mean by agentic](https://thenewstack.io/the-architects-guide-to-understanding-agentic-ai/) AI. [AI agents are software](https://thenewstack.io/how-brands-can-use-ai-in-2025-to-close-the-cx-expectation-gap/) programs that can autonomously take actions to achieve pre-assigned goals. This software is meant to continuously collect and leverage data and constantly learn ways to improve upon those preset goals. Like most AI software, they require training and intervention when necessary.

## Agentic AI’s Promises and What To Watch Out For
The concept of an AI agent isn’t new — we’ve just come a long way from early iterations. For example, chatbots and Siri have been around for a while. Newer iterations, like ChatGPT and Gemini, and even updated versions of Siri, have progressed each day and transformed how we interact with AI agents.

With newer AI agents’ ability to learn, it democratizes AI use to non-experts and allows a perpetual improvement of [processes that aren’t always dependent](https://thenewstack.io/value-stream-management-process-depends-on-architecture/) on an expert. Despite these promises, organizations must avoid some ** potential** pitfalls as they seek to leverage Agentic AI.

**The Relationship Between Talent and Agentic AI**
Many of us in the IT/cybersecurity sector know about the ongoing talent shortages. Agentic AI can streamline processes, helping mitigate these talent gaps. If appropriately trained, AI agents can initiate cybersecurity alerts and begin remediation. They can also enhance observability operations and smooth out customer interactions through intuitive chatbots.

The potential pitfall arrives if IT leaders look to agentic AI to solve their talent shortages completely. As their dependence on AI grows, [organizations will need](https://thenewstack.io/why-your-organization-needs-an-open-source-program-office/) to hire talent fluent in using AI so they can intervene to improve its functionality. In addition, as AI frees up specific talent to focus on other tasks or departments, business leaders may have to reconsider their organizational structure.

**Like Any New Technology, There Are Security Risks**
Remember to introduce data into a self-deterministic entity connected to your IT environment and [data when using AI agents](https://thenewstack.io/agentic-ai-for-enterprises-4-key-benefits-driving-innovation/). Depending on the agent, the data may even interact with third parties. A potential pitfall is a breach that occurs and expands using AI agents as a medium. This could put personally identifiable information (PII) at risk and decrease customer confidence in your ability to protect their privacy.

**Realizing the Promises of Agentic AI**
There are several ways to avoid these mishaps. First, sound data management is essential. When AI is [trained on quality data](https://thenewstack.io/how-training-data-differentiates-falcon-the-llm-from-the-uae/), it can produce quality results. Quality data management includes properly securing data, retrieving valuable data from legacy systems, and [safely making data](https://thenewstack.io/7-llm-risks-and-api-management-strategies/) accessible to relevant stakeholders. It also [means establishing sound data](https://thenewstack.io/enterprise-ai-requires-a-lean-mean-data-machine/) governance policies.

Upskilling and training staff on responsible AI use will also set an organization up for success. AI [Agents may offer](https://thenewstack.io/elastic-profiling-agent-offers-a-4th-pillar-of-observability/) opportunities for new roles that won’t be filled outside the organization. This means offering training or upskilling paths to hire from within. Certain employees may [need training on how to use Agentic](https://thenewstack.io/4-reasons-your-ai-agent-needs-code-interpreter/) AI to improve their current roles.

Lastly, AI mustn’t operate on its own *all* the time. Therefore, provide intervention methods. Establish a program for constant check-ins to ensure the agent serves as intended. Following these suggestions could help today’s organizations fully realize the promises of agentic AI in 2025 and beyond.
