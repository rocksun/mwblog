As the infrastructure and cost barriers around enterprise AI fall away, software developers, engineers, architects and other builders are running through the gates, looking to use the newest technologies — [agentic AI](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-a-comprehensive-introduction-for-developers/), large language models ([LLMs](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-a-large-language-model/)) and model context protocol ([MCP](https://thenewstack.io/model-context-protocol-a-primer-for-the-developers/)) — to innovate.

But once you get past that fence, what’s next? Experimentation takes you only so far — the real goal is to use that knowledge to build scalable AI solutions that deliver powerful business outcomes.

Can you make the strategic shift from tinkering to testing to shipping? And then ensure that the products and services you build and ship will withstand the ever-evolving AI landscape?

## Learn How To Put AI Into Action

Whether you’re just getting started with enterprise AI or you’re an experienced user scaling solutions across teams, you probably have a lot of questions. To help you get answers, The New Stack is partnering with Red Hat and Intel for a special online event, [**AI in Action: From Experimentation to Enterprise Impact**](https://thenewstack.io/webinar/ai-in-action-from-experimentation-to-enterprise-impact/)**, on July 22 at 1 p.m. ET | 10 a.m. PT.**

In this free webinar, leaders from Red Hat, Intel and Dynatrace will join TNS Host [Chris Pirillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrispirillo/) to share practical insights and real-world examples of using AI in the enterprise to better respond to customer and organizational needs.

If you can’t join us live, register anyway and we’ll send you a recording following the webinar.

Here’s what you can expect:

### Part 1: The Pragmatic and Flexible AI Roadmap

In this conversation, **Red Hat Field CTO [Matt Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dotmjs/)** and **TNS Host Chris Pirillo** will discuss ways to use AI to drive efficiency, automate manual processes, and reduce toil and technical debt.

Smith will also explain where companies often get stuck on their AI journey, including how to set realistic expectations at the outset and ways to scale without getting bogged down in complexity.

### Part 2: Lessons Learned From Successful AI Adoptions

AI is everywhere, but achieving real value is rare. Successful enterprise AI adoption — with the metrics to prove it — requires more than just vibing your way to a product or service. You need to move beyond experimenting to building AI that works and delivers business results.

This panel of industry leaders will help you make that leap by sharing practical, real-world examples that you can incorporate into your AI strategy:

They’ll chat about best practices for deploying AI in the enterprise using open source, model-agnostic technologies and balancing innovation, governance, and scalability.

## What You’ll Learn

By attending this special online event, you’ll leave with best practices, real-world examples and actionable tips including:

* How to simplify and scale AI development and deployment across hybrid cloud environments.
* Ways to improve AI performance with efficient inference, better memory use and higher GPU utilization.
* How to deploy any model, on any hardware accelerator, using an open and extensible AI platform.
* Best practices for managing the full life cycle of predictive and generative AI (GenAI) models at scale.
