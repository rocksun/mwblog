Agentic AI is advancing faster than most of us realize. [Gartner predicts](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-10-21-gartner-identifies-the-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2025) that, by 2028, at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be made autonomously through agentic AI. That’s across all functions; in development, we’re witnessing not just incremental improvements but an exponential leap in capability that will fundamentally transform how we build and deploy software.

[Consider Cursor AI](https://sacra.com/research/cursor-at-100m-arr/), an AI-powered code editor that has recently become the fastest SaaS company to reach $100 million in revenue. This milestone isn’t just impressive, it’s an indication of the immense change about to hit the development world.
This is just the beginning. Since the start of the year, GPT-4.5, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Llama 4, Grok 3, and Gemini 2.5 have all been launched. The high level of engagement with these models and their subsequent releases highlights that an AI education is essential, not optional, in the modern workforce. Models are getting exponentially better, more capable, and, critically for widespread adoption, cheaper by the day.

**The 10X Developer Is Now AI-Augmented **
That means we’ve reached a pivotal moment in development. Anyone [writing code without AI assistance might](https://thenewstack.io/why-literate-programming-might-help-you-write-better-code/) as well write with pen and paper.

This isn’t hyperbole. The productivity gap between AI-augmented developers and traditional coders is already substantial and growing wider every day. [One study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12195) found that a combined 73% of developers said that ChatGPT improves their productivity. The efficiency, speed, and capabilities that AI [brings to the development process create a new standard](https://thenewstack.io/new-open-source-standard-brings-consistency-to-webhooks/), which is rapidly making traditional coding methods appear outdated.

There are experienced developers who dismiss AI’s capabilities, particularly when it comes to creative problem-solving. They look at today’s tools and think, “Sure, it can handle boilerplate, but it can’t tackle the complex, nuanced challenges of real-world development.”

This stance is becoming increasingly dangerous. AI is doing more than just getting better — it’s getting better at improving. What seems impossible today will be routine tomorrow; as a result, those resistant today will be redundant tomorrow.

Rather than skepticism, the most productive response is to embrace AI in your development workflow fully. Current capabilities may impress or disappoint depending on your perspective, but the tools available a year from now will likely be much more powerful than what we have today.

**As AI Evolves, So Should You**
This is about remaining relevant, not just competitive. We are rapidly approaching the point where attempting to code commercially without AI assistance will seem as antiquated as programming without modern IDEs, version control, or internet access was ten years ago. Those who embrace AI in their development today will be much better placed to take advantage than those who continue to dismiss it.

[With Gartner predicting that 80% of software developers will require AI training by 2027](https://the-decoder.com/80-of-software-developers-will-require-ai-training-by-2027-gartner-study-finds/), the AI literacy gap is at a critical juncture. Developers and [tech leaders have a responsibility to embed learning opportunities](https://thenewstack.io/3-strategies-to-turn-incidents-into-learning-opportunities/) around AI, or risk losing out on the financial and efficiency benefits. This is more than just feeding market hype; it’s an opportunity to equip [developers with the skills they need](https://thenewstack.io/recruiters-speak-top-skills-devs-need-for-ai-cloud-jobs/) to produce tangible results.
Crucially, an AI education must include clarity on [deploying AI responsibly in developer settings](https://thenewstack.io/set-goals-and-measure-progress-for-effective-ai-deployment/), which helps cement trust in its outputs and avoids legal or ethical ramifications. [Misinformation and disinformation in AI are a top ethical concern for 79% of developers](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/ai/), meaning that developers using AI must have the skillset to identify and mitigate these risks effectively.

**The Software Revolution Will Be AI-Driven **
As AI assistance makes developers 10 to 100 times more productive, we’re not looking at a future with fewer developers; instead, demand for software will skyrocket as costs decrease.

When the price of development dramatically decreases, companies will realize they can create and deploy software in situations where it was previously economically unfeasible. Entire categories of software that were once too expensive to build will suddenly become viable. Think about all the internal tools, specialized applications, and niche solutions that businesses have wanted but couldn’t justify the development costs for. When development becomes an order of magnitude cheaper and faster, these projects won’t just become feasible; they’ll become obvious investments.

This [transformation will reshape the software](https://thenewstack.io/ebooks/generative-ai/how-generative-ai-transforms-software-development/) product landscape over the next decade. Some businesses may see this as an opportunity to reduce their development teams significantly. A handful of AI-augmented developers will likely outperform much larger departments of traditional coders.

Yet businesses need to understand that humans are still very much required. The ability to produce huge amounts of software doesn’t come without risks. What will separate successful software products from obsolete ones? The answer lies not in the code itself but in the human elements surrounding it: taste, user experience, and curation. The journey of AI-aided development requires human oversight, evidenced by a projected [17.9% increase in employment for software developers between 2023 and 2033](https://www.developer-tech.com/news/ai-impact-on-software-development-jobs/).

**Bridging the AI Capability Gap**
An AI-powered code editor can act upon instructions; it cannot yet understand a business requirement and deliver a piece of code that meets those exact needs. Companies that fail to understand this will simply create software equivalent to the AI-generated content that is overwhelming much of the internet today.

Organizations need developers to leverage their expertise, bridging the gap between the raw capabilities of AI and business needs. They aren’t doing the actual coding, but they can explain how it all comes together and define the requirements to support it: how it is hosted, the underlying architecture, and the security implications.

AI is another layer in the software development stack. We’ve been developing software for decades, but what that looks like fifty years ago and what that looks like now is very different, even without AI. In this scenario, AI takes another step forward (albeit a very powerful and genuinely transformative one).

**Adapt Now or Become Obsolete **
The divide is no longer between coders and non-coders — it’s between those augmented by AI and those left behind. Each day you postpone [integrating AI into your development workflow](https://thenewstack.io/prepare-developers-for-integrating-ai-into-their-workflows/), the gap widens exponentially.

The organizations that thrive won’t be those with the most developers, but those whose developers most effectively harness AI. The multiplier effect will be so profound that a small team of AI-augmented developers will routinely outperform entire departments of traditional coders.

The question isn’t whether to embrace AI-powered development, but how quickly you can integrate it into every aspect of your workflow. Your future in [software development depends](https://thenewstack.io/the-configuration-crisis-and-developer-dependency-on-ai/) on your answer.
