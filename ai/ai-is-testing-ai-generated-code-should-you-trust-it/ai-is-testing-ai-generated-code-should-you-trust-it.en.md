There’s no denying it: More and more software development organizations are turning to AI to write code. More than [30% of Google’s code](https://abc.xyz/2025-q1-earnings-call/) is written by AI; at Microsoft, the number is “[as much as 30%](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/satya-nadella-says-as-much-as-30percent-of-microsoft-code-is-written-by-ai.html).”

While generative AI (GenAI) can write more code more quickly than human developers, increasing the [sense of productivity](https://thenewstack.io/more-ai-more-problems-for-software-developers-in-2025/), there’s a major problem: AI-written code is unpredictable, often inaccurate, obscure and requires significant debugging effort.

According to [Harness’](https://harness.io/products/continuous-integration?utm_content=inline+mention) [State of Software Delivery 2025](https://www.harness.io/state-of-software-delivery) report, two-thirds of developers say they spend excessive time debugging and resolving security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code. As AI becomes the engine behind modern software delivery, ensuring the reliability and safety of AI-driven workflows is mission-critical.

## Could AI Be the Answer?

As organizations try to solve these problems, many are exploring ways to use GenAI to test their code, both AI and non-AI workflows. It seems counterintuitive: Why would you use unpredictable technology to test unpredictable technology?

Fortunately, this is not only possible, but companies like Harness are already successfully putting it into practice. And in an upcoming webinar, **[AI Testing AI: How to Build Unbreakable Validation for Unpredictable Systems](https://thenewstack.io/webinar/ai-testing-ai-how-to-build-unbreakable-validation-for-unpredictable-systems/)**, you’ll have the opportunity to see exactly how Harness is using AI-powered test generation, self-healing test suites, and intelligent test selection to validate AI workflows.

During this free webinar on August 19, at 10:30 a.m. PT | 1:30 ET, **[Deba Chatterjee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/debachatterjee/)** and **[Rohan Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swarnendurohan-gupta?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAA5Tp78BSGz8gh-5n-kbC9HBrZzYsci-zo4&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BNms%2BBkcSTAWdRfdzzcxYHw%3D%3D)** of Harness will join The New Stack Host **[Chris Pirillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrispirillo)** to pull back the curtain on how Harness uses advanced agentic AI-powered testing to rigorously validate its own AI workflows.

They will not only demonstrate the power of AI in testing AI; they will also explore how to use agentic AI-powered testing to test non-AI workflows.
