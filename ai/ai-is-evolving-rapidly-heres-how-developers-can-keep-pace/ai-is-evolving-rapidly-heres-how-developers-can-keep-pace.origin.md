I’ve worked closely with developers for many years and through many phases of technology. I can confidently say[ the pace at which AI innovation](https://thenewstack.io/whats-ahead-for-ai-assisted-coding-open-source-and-more/) is happening is unlike anything we’ve seen before. Efficiency is key for developers to keep this pace and for the industry to reach a point where AI can scale for everyone’s benefit. It’s achieved in deploying AI-based workloads through seamless hardware-software integration.

Understanding the [compute requirements](https://thenewstack.io/whats-driving-the-rising-cost-of-observability/) behind training and inference is critical to scaling efficient deployment across various devices.

**Accessing the Fastest and Most Efficient Deployment Methods**
Speed and efficiency are non-negotiable when deploying AI in real-world applications. For example, edge AI must process data close to the source, often with low latency, to enable real-time responses. This is especially critical for telemedicine, autonomous vehicles, and online gaming apps.

Developers need the right deployment tools to accelerate model iteration, helping bring solutions to market faster. Frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://thenewstack.io/python-tutorial-use-tensorflow-to-generate-predictive-text/) and [PyTorch](https://thenewstack.io/why-pytorch-gets-all-the-love/) offer robust, developer-friendly environments. The latest Llama 3.2 1B/3B models, combined with [the recent ExecuTorch Beta release](https://pytorch.org/blog/executorch-beta/)__,__ enable developers to export and run PyTorch models on edge devices like mobile phones and microcontrollers, streamlining AI model deployment regardless of the platform.

Understanding the importance of these frameworks is essential for developers seeking to balance speed and efficiency. They enable fast, iterative development and bring AI workloads closer to the edge, ensuring optimal application performance even with constrained resources.

**Enabling Scalable AI Across the Open Source Ecosystem**
As AI technology expands, establishing interoperability is essential. Standardized APIs and libraries offer consistency, allowing developers to build and deploy models across various platforms without constantly reconfiguring their code. This significantly reduces project development time, allowing developers to focus on innovating and creating differentiating value through their unique application functionality rather than solving compatibility issues.

In my role at Arm, I’ve been committed to improving interoperability, as seen in our latest partnership and collaboration with the PyTorch teams at Meta, where we’re supporting the mission to deliver a model-exchange framework that fosters interoperability and compatibility of models and algorithms across the AI ecosystem. By integrating compute libraries, performance optimizations, and microkernels to support the underlying Arm architecture, we enable compatibility and performance enhancement across the entire range of Arm servers, like AWS Graviton in the cloud and end devices at the edge, whether smartphones or single board computers like Raspberry Pi. Developers can work directly with the latest Llama 3.2 models, Pytorc,h, and Executorch framework without additional modifications or optimizations, saving time and resources.

We take this enablement approach across the entire ecosystem, including several other foundational frameworks like TensorFlow and open source inference libraries like Google’s XNNPACK, to democratize and simplify AI development for the billions of Arm-based devices worldwide. Developers can more efficiently deliver robust and scalable AI solutions with an ecosystem of tools and frameworks.

** Building a Collaborative Ecosystem for Optimal Performance **
It’s important to underscore that AI’s evolution goes beyond open source frameworks and depends heavily on partnerships and collaboration between developers, hardware vendors, ML and DevOps ISVs, and research communities. Collaboration helps hardware teams fine-tune AI models and their execution on the underlying hardware, ensuring they maximize performance without sacrificing efficiency. A great example is [tAWS’s work to accelerate Pytorch inference with a torch .compile on Graviton. ](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/accelerated-pytorch-inference-with-torch-compile-on-aws-graviton-processors/)Partnerships with cloud service providers running Arm-based servers build on earlier open source initiatives by incorporating hardware-specific optimizations into the workflow. This simplifies the development process, so developers don’t have to handle these optimizations themselves.

ML ISVs like Databricks also play a key role, offering developers intelligence platforms, runtimes, and workflows that support Arm-optimized resources like AWS Graviton to tackle deployment challenges while advancing shared goals in AI scalability and performance.

Of course, model development, MLOps, and DevOps are essential. Developers use platforms like HuggingFace and GitHub to collaborate, innovate, and deploy the latest models and frameworks. They make AI development fundamental and ubiquitous.

Recently, GitHub proposed a [simplified MLOps recipe](https://github.blog/enterprise-software/ci-cd/streamlining-your-mlops-pipeline-with-github-actions-and-arm64-runners/) for streamlined development. A great example is [a simplified MLOps recipe GitHub recently proposed for streamlined development](https://github.blog/enterprise-software/ci-cd/streamlining-your-mlops-pipeline-with-github-actions-and-arm64-runners/). We ran with their proposal and [created a tutorial implementing GitHub’s recipe](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/gh-runners/) to demystify MLOps for developers everywhere. Our partnership with GitHub and learning paths that enable developers to get a jumpstart with real-world PyTorch-based examples help ensure even developers just getting started have streamlined MLOps workflows and optimized performance on Day One.

**Conclusion **
We’re staring down a once-in-a-generation opportunity with AI, and developers — along with their collaborators in hardware and software — hold the key to unlocking this technology’s full promise. I have spent much of my career working across the AI community. Since joining Arm last year, my mission has been to empower developers worldwide to create cutting-edge AI and application capabilities on Arm as the most ubiquitous platform on the planet.

The path to scaling AI to meet the demands of industries and communities worldwide includes three areas of focus: efficiency, interoperability, and collaboration. Through seamless hardware-software integration, robust open source frameworks, and partnerships that simplify and enhance AI development, we can continue to enable the growth of AI in a way that is accessible, sustainable, and impactful for everyone.
