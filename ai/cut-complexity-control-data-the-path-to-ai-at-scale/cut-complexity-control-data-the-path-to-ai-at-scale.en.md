We’re moving from hype to implementation in the AI adoption arc. Consequently, enterprises’ expectations of AI, its impact and anticipated return on investment (ROI) are peaking. It’s no longer about whether your enterprise will deploy AI (and in which departments); it’s about how successful the deployments are, and what’s needed to scale AI successfully and effectively.

Couchbase recently conducted a global [survey](https://info.couchbase.com/rs/302-GJY-034/images/Couchbase_CIO%20Survey%20Report%202026_FINAL.pdf?version=0) of 800 senior IT decision-makers (e.g., CIOs, CTOs, CDOs) from businesses with 1,000+ employees to gauge their progress implementing AI, including how investment, experimentation and data strategies are contributing to their AI success. According to the research, AI investment is growing 52% year-on-year, faster than digital modernization as a whole, and 73% of senior IT decision-makers are excited for AI’s potential.

However, [data challenges](https://thenewstack.io/why-use-a-nosql-database-for-ai-there-are-many-great-reasons/) and [security concerns](https://thenewstack.io/can-ai-defeat-authentication-depends-on-who-you-ask/) are holding businesses back. To turn AI into a [competitive advantage](https://thenewstack.io/enterprise-ai-success-demands-real-time-data-platforms), organizations must take control of their data and build a strong architectural foundation. IT leaders need to act quickly or risk losing up to $87 million in revenue annually.

## The Looming Deadline To Embrace AI

According to our research, almost all (96%) respondents recognize there is a deadline by which their organization needs to embrace AI. The general consensus (87%) is that organizations need to embrace AI within the next six months, while more than a quarter say the deadline has already passed. Further, the majority (78%) of senior IT decision-makers agree that early AI adopters will see the greatest success and become industry leaders, and 59% are concerned that their business will be displaced by smaller competitors who are better able to take advantage of AI.

While C-suite IT leaders understand they must adopt AI quickly to stay competitive, many lack the foundation to achieve it effectively: 64% express concern that “decision paralysis” means their organization is not taking advantage of AI as quickly as it could. Compounding this, 66% state they are concerned that AI and the different approaches to AI are evolving faster than their organization can keep pace.

Despite the fact that large enterprises (companies with at least 10,000 employees) are spending an average of $30 million annually on AI, issues persist that are preventing and disrupting related projects. These challenges include the perception that the risk of failure was or has become too high, the inability to secure the necessary budget or stay within budget, problems accessing or managing the required data, and a lack of confidence that the project would meet security or compliance demands. On average, these issues caused enterprises to delay their strategic goals by almost six months, with a potential cost of up to $42 million.

So how can companies move forward with AI confidently? They need to focus on three things: consolidating their AI architecture to reduce tech stack complexity, costs and risks; establishing a data strategy that ensures strong security and control; and implementing controls that protect the organization without overly restricting innovation and experimentation.

## The Keys To AI Success

The keys to safe and effective in-house use of AI include ensuring architecture is high-performance and flexible enough to support generative AI (GenAI); monitoring and managing GenAI application use; and encouraging safe experimentation that will result in increased understanding and new capabilities. Let’s dive into what each of these means.

On average, enterprises say their current architecture has an average lifespan of 18 months before it can no longer support in-house AI applications. The more complex an AI architecture is, the less governable it becomes. Uncontrolled architectural sprawl is exposing enterprises to unacceptable risk, making consolidation a priority.

Every respondent we surveyed reported that their organization has taken action to reduce the size of their AI stack, including updating their strategy to consolidate IT infrastructure, using AI applications to perform multiple functions and replace legacy applications, and reducing and consolidating the number of third-party AI services and applications in use.

While this is a good start, more needs to be done. Traditional data architectures built for deterministic workloads and structured data are not equipped to support AI’s demands for [diverse, unstructured data](https://thenewstack.io/from-unstructured-data-to-rag-ready-with-docling) and probable reasoning. Companies must implement new data architectures that go beyond simple record storage to capture the “intelligence history” and thought processes of AI systems.

A key step here is to simplify complex architectures to properly support AI workloads. These evolved architectures should incorporate robust security measures for both data and AI communications. They should also prioritize transparency and governance so organizations can track how their data was used in AI training, monitor the decision-making processes of AI systems and maintain detailed records of AI-generated insights and their underlying reasoning.

Equally important to AI success is establishing strong data controls. Every enterprise we surveyed encountered AI issues that stemmed from a lack of data control. Issues included AI sharing another organization’s intellectual property or other proprietary information as part of an answer; AI using or accessing proprietary data from within the organization; AI “hallucinations” that employees acted on before they recognized them as such; and losing the efficiency benefits of AI through having to double-check its output.

To gain a better understanding of AI preparedness, enterprises need to focus on their [data management strategy](https://thenewstack.io/why-ai-agents-need-an-operational-database/), including control over data protection, storage, access and use, and adopt technology to manage and access data at scale and at speed. One way to achieve this is by requiring inference capabilities to be hosted within the organization’s boundaries, whether in virtual private clouds or customer-configured environments, to ensure sensitive data never leaves secure environments.

The final piece of the puzzle is encouraging AI experimentation. According to our survey, enterprises that encourage experimentation see more consistent AI success: Projects are 10% more likely to enter production, and companies spend 13% less on the AI project than enterprises with more restrictive approaches. Further, 81% of senior IT decision-makers agree that education and experimentation are critical elements of AI development, and 74% say that even failed AI projects have value in terms of the learnings they provide for next time.

## Making It Work

It is clear that embracing AI with guardrails will be critical to maintaining competitive advantage: 80% of senior IT leaders agree that we are entering an AI world, and enterprises have no choice but to build applications for it.

Creating and operating AI applications at scale hinges on the right approach to data management. Enterprises must implement robust controls and simplify data architectures using comprehensive and unified multipurpose data platforms that support the variety of data required for AI. With the proper foundations in place, enterprises can confidently navigate their AI environment and the data that supports it, unleashing AI’s full potential without compromising security.
