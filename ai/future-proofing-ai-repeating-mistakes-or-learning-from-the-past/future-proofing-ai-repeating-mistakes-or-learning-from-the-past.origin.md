In the heart of Silicon Valley, tech titans are unleashing an unprecedented $320 billion AI infrastructure spending spree for 2025 alone. Amazon’s planned $100 billion capital expenditure represents a dramatic leap from its $77 billion investment last year. Meanwhile, [Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/?utm_content=inline+mention), [Google](https://cloud.google.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) and [Meta](https://about.meta.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) are collectively boosting their infrastructure investments by 30% compared to 2024. We’ve seen this movie before — and it doesn’t always have a happy ending.

As a 25-year-old self-taught software engineer who has immersed myself in the technologies of multiple computing revolutions, I’ve studied the patterns that emerge when paradigms shift. From the transition of on-premises software to virtualization, from virtual machines (VMs) to cloud native [containers](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-containers/), and now into the [AI era](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-a-comprehensive-introduction-for-developers/), the cycle is unmistakable. History always repeats itself: velocity trumps security, inefficiencies are accepted as the price of innovation and technical debt accumulates silently until it becomes crippling.

**The Lessons of Digital Transformation Past**
Remember the rush to cloud computing? Organizations migrated workloads wholesale, often without redesigning for [cloud native](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native/) efficiencies. Take Netflix’s migration to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?utm_content=inline+mention), which began in 2008 but took nearly eight years to complete. Its initial “lift-and-shift” approach caused significant outages, including the Christmas Eve 2012 disruption that affected millions of customers. Only after adopting cloud native principles and developing tools like its [Chaos Monkey](https://thenewstack.io/chaos-engineering-business-value/) resilience testing system did AWS achieve the reliability and efficiency the cloud promised.

Then came containerization — a transformative approach promising greater efficiency and portability. Yet many organizations implemented containers atop existing infrastructure without addressing fundamental security and performance concerns. Target [experienced](https://www.ciodive.com/news/target-cloud-migration/628448/) this firsthand during its container adoption journey, discovering that its traditional security tools couldn’t adequately protect containerized workloads, leading to visibility gaps and potential vulnerabilities. X’s (formerly known as Twitter) famous and embarrassingly frequent “[Fail Whale](https://www.wired.com/2013/11/qa-with-chris-fry/)” was a consequence of trying to run a monolithic Ruby application with poorly designed failure handling. The industry gradually matured, developing orchestration platforms like [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/) and standardized security practices, but not before making costly missteps that proper planning could have avoided.

Each of these transitions followed a similar trajectory: initial exuberance, rushed implementation, security as an afterthought, inefficient resource utilization and eventually, a more mature approach that balanced innovation with enterprise requirements.

## Learning From the Past To Save Tomorrow’s Innovation
Today’s AI boom risks falling into these same traps — only with higher stakes. Training OpenAI’s GPT-4 reportedly cost [over $100 million](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-the-age-of-giant-ai-models-is-already-over/) in computing resources alone. The computational demands of modern AI are enormous, with companies like Microsoft building specialized supercomputers just to train these models. The race to deploy AI applications has organizations accepting tremendous inefficiencies in how these workloads run.

The AI gold rush has naturally also had the corresponding effect of a surge in AI projects introduced. [GitHub’s Octoverse 2024 report](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/) cited 137,000 generative AI (GenAI) projects hosted on GitHub, up 98% year over year from 2023. If we’ve learned nothing else from the last few years of software supply chain security attacks, it’s that open source projects are severely under-resourced from a security perspective.

Are the enterprises rushing to deploy new open source AI projects taking the necessary security measures to isolate them from the rest of their infrastructure? Or are they disregarding recent open source security history and trusting them by default?

Alarmingly, there are also reports that China-, North Korea- and Russia-based cybercriminal groups are actively targeting both physical and AI infrastructure while leveraging AI-generated malware to exploit vulnerabilities more efficiently. A 2024 Microsoft [study](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftdefendercloudblog/new-innovations-in-container-security-with-unified-visibility-investigations-and/4298593) found that container-based workloads, including AI systems, face increasing threats, with container adoption expected to reach 52% by 2024, accompanied by rising security challenges.

Yet there’s reason for optimism. The lessons of previous technological transitions can inform a better approach to AI infrastructure — one that delivers the agility businesses need while establishing a secure, efficient foundation from the start.

**The Container Conundrum: Powerful but Imperfect**
While containers have revolutionized application deployment, they bring significant challenges when applied to AI workloads.

**Resource Inefficiency**
Standard containerization often leads to resource waste. For instance, Uber’s engineering team [discovered](https://www.uber.com/blog/scaling-ai-ml-infrastructure-at-uber/) its containerized machine learning (ML) services were utilizing only 20-30% of allocated GPU resources, effectively wasting 70-80% of its expensive AI infrastructure. This inefficiency compounds with AI workloads, which are already resource-intensive.

**Security Vulnerabilities**
Container security remains a persistent challenge. Containers share the host’s operating system (OS) kernel, creating unique attack vectors that traditional security tools can’t address. The ephemeral nature of containers makes security monitoring particularly difficult, as Microsoft [notes](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftdefendercloudblog/new-innovations-in-container-security-with-unified-visibility-investigations-and/4298593) that security teams struggle to identify which containers are running at any given time and pinpoint vulnerable ones.

**Performance Bottlenecks**
Containers introduce overhead that’s particularly problematic for AI workloads. Netflix’s engineering team [documented](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/navigating-network-challenges-case-study-netflixs-traffic-gogte-xlotf/) how its ML inference services faced latency issues when containerized due to networking and I/O bottlenecks inherent in container architecture. For real-time AI applications, these performance penalties can be unacceptable.

**Operational Complexity**
The dynamic nature of containerized environments introduces significant operational complexity. According to [Flexential’s State of AI Infrastructure Report](https://www.flexential.com/system/files/file/2024-07/flexential-state-of-ai-infrastructure-report-2024-hvc.pdf) 2024, 82% of organizations encountered performance issues with their AI workloads in the past 12 months, often stemming from the operational challenges of managing containerized environments.

**Building a Future-Proof AI Infrastructure**
The solution to our current infrastructure challenges isn’t abandoning containers or slowing innovation — it’s applying time-tested principles while adapting them for AI’s unique demands. A thoughtful approach combines the reliability of proven technologies with the agility modern development teams require.

**Reimagining Virtualization for the AI Age**
The virtualization technology that revolutionized computing two decades ago remains fundamentally sound, but we saw the opportunity to give the decades-old tech a facelift to meet the demands and gaps of modern computing. Reimplementing hypervisor technology like Xen in memory-safe languages such as [Rust](https://thenewstack.io/rust-programming-language/) provides the battle-tested security isolation of traditional virtualization with dramatically improved performance and resource efficiency.

Instead of the traditional one-size-fits-all container approach, this modernized virtualization dynamically allocates resources based on actual AI workload demands, eliminating the overprovisioning problem that plagues standard containerization.

**Security by Design, Not Afterthought**
Rather than bolting security onto inherently vulnerable systems, future-proof infrastructure builds security at the foundation. By implementing true isolation at the kernel level through modernized hypervisor technology, organizations can create secure multitenancy from the start — a critical requirement for AI workloads processing sensitive data.

**Performance Without Compromise**
Next-generation AI infrastructure cannot be beholden to performance penalties that arise from using today’s solutions to create true, secure, multitenant environments. By combining the best aspects of bare-metal performance with container-like deployment models, organizations can build systems that deliver both speed and convenience. For example, Edera’s technology, which does not require hardware, is [41% faster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04580) than Kata Containers — one of the only hardware-reliant alternative approaches — for real workloads.

This architecture maintains the deployment benefits developers love about containers while eliminating the performance bottlenecks that make containerized AI workloads struggle.

**Unified Management That Simplifies Complexity**
The most successful approach to AI infrastructure integrates seamlessly with existing systems rather than creating isolated silos. By unifying management across traditional and AI workloads, organizations can maintain consistent security, governance and operational practices.

Platform teams gain the visibility and control they need, while developers maintain the velocity they require — proving that security and speed are not mutually exclusive when the infrastructure is designed correctly.

**The Path Forward**
The AI revolution we’re experiencing didn’t emerge from nothing. I spent my teenage years learning about older computing paradigms before they were fashionable — diving into hypervisors, reading about the architectural decisions behind Xen and KVM and exploring operating system design principles from the 1970s and ’80s — and I’ve come to appreciate how technological history offers solutions to our most pressing challenges.

When I first encountered virtualization through projects like Xen, I was struck by how elegantly it solved the resource-sharing and security isolation problems facing edge devices. The computer scientists who designed these systems were solving fundamental problems that transcend specific technology trends. Their solutions, updated for modern hardware and implemented in memory-safe languages like Rust, remain powerful tools for addressing AI’s infrastructure demands.

We cannot build a solid future if we ignore the wisdom of the past. The foundations of computing security, resource management and operational efficiency were laid decades ago by pioneers who had to make every CPU cycle and memory byte count. Their lessons are more relevant now than ever as we build systems that consume unprecedented computational resources.

The organizations that will outlast in the AI era won’t necessarily be those with the largest infrastructure investments or the trendiest technology stacks. The leaders will be those who recognize that looking backward is sometimes the best way to move forward, adapting time-tested principles while embracing the specific needs of modern AI workloads.

As someone who has studied both the triumphs and failures of computing’s past, I’m convinced that our best path forward involves thoughtfully applying yesterday’s wisdom to tomorrow’s challenges. The lessons are there for those of us willing to learn them.
