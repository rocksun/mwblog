For all the hype about developer productivity and AI coding tools, recent research has thrown a reality check on expectations. In July, METR reported that “when developers use AI tools, they [take 19% longer](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/) than without” — even though [they think](https://thenewstack.io/the-top-ai-tool-for-devs-isnt-github-copilot-new-report-finds/) it’s making them more productive.

Despite the apparent disconnect between productivity gains, perception and reality around these tools, companies continue to invest in and developers continue to use them, expecting that the return on investment (ROI) will come sooner than later.

What they may not be considering, though, is that generating code isn’t the biggest barrier to developer productivity, and evaluating the quality of code that AI generates is a larger factor than they believe.

In “The 2025 State of Web Dev AI” study, [76% of respondents](https://thenewstack.io/ai-generated-code-needs-refactoring-say-76-of-developers/) said they must refactor AI-generated code due to things like hallucinations, inaccuracies, lack of context and poor code quality. All that work to ensure code quality and reliability — and to fix the issues uncovered — takes a lot of time that decreases how productive developers can actually be.

## Destroy the Roadblocks Holding Devs Back

If AI code generation isn’t delivering the efficiency and output AI has promised, join us on Oct. 9, 2025, at 11 a.m. PT | 2 p.m. ET for a special online event, [How To Stop AI From Slowing Developers Down](https://thenewstack.io/webinar/how-to-stop-ai-from-slowing-developers-down/).

During this free webinar, [Will Wilson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-wilson-330276112/), co-founder and CEO, and [Akshay Shah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshayjshah/), field CTO, at [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com/), and TNS Host [Chris Pirillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrispirillo) will discuss why AI isn’t boosting engineering productivity, the bottlenecks engineering organizations face and how to make the gains you’re looking for.
