Technology leaders across every industry are seeking ways to optimize AI’s benefits throughout their software development workflows. This widespread adoption is shaping the software development landscape and raising important questions about the future of work in the tech industry.
While many are concerned about how AI’s implementation will affect jobs, it’s more likely that AI will create new jobs and upskilling opportunities rather than simply replacing existing roles. The key is to view AI as a supplement to humans, not as a replacement.
As we stand on the brink of this transformation, engineering leaders must prepare their organizations for the next stage of software development to
[ensure they use AI to drive innovation](https://thenewstack.io/empowering-developers-is-critical-to-drive-ai-innovation/). Let’s explore how organizations can prepare their teams, processes and cultures to maximize the potential of AI in software development.
**Evolving Job Roles**
As
[AI becomes more integrated](https://thenewstack.io/ai-has-become-integral-to-the-software-delivery-lifecycle/), we’ll see a heightened demand for new roles, such as AI engineers and prompt engineers. These positions will be crucial in bridging the gap between traditional software development and AI-driven processes.
In the early stages of this transition, it’s crucial for organizations to clearly define the scope of responsibilities, though they will continue to change over time. This will help team members understand their roles within evolving organizations while ensuring leaders can set reasonable expectations for their teams.
The emergence of more
[specialized roles within software development](https://thenewstack.io/rapid-innovation-in-vehicle-connectivity-is-creating-new-developer-roles/) will present developers with an exciting opportunity to enhance their skills, take on new challenges and expand their career paths.
**Reskilling and Reeducating**
As roles evolve, it will become even more critical that engineers continue
[expanding their skill sets and stay current](https://thenewstack.io/5-software-development-skills-ai-will-render-obsolete/) with software development trends. This need for continuous learning is not new to the industry, but the pace of change is accelerating dramatically.
Previously, changes such as new tools, processes or standards for speed of delivery happened every 18 months to two years. Technology leaders should constantly challenge their teams to think about incorporating AI into their daily work to stay ahead of this curve. There are many ways to apply AI to software development workflows, from code generation and testing to project management and documentation. Over time, engineers will better understand how to support deep learning and AI development on their teams.
Continuous upskilling, adoption and support are critical to responsibly unlocking AI’s potential. Upskilling developers to ensure they can use and maintain AI systems effectively is critical to AI’s sustainable adoption and evolution. Developers at all levels can learn effective prompt engineering techniques while maintaining coding skills. Junior developers in particular can benefit from an always-on coding partner to learn from, helping them grow into productive, efficient team members more rapidly than ever before.
**Investing in Workplace Culture**
Leaders play a crucial role in guiding their organizations through this AI-driven transformation. They must incorporate flexibility within their organizations and encourage trial and error when using AI. Everything from how we evaluate and motivate our teams to how we measure success will need to change.
To foster innovation, leaders must invest in tools and processes that enable their teams to experiment with AI, find new ways to use it and create innovative products. This investment goes beyond just acquiring technology; it includes creating a culture that embraces experimentation and learning from failure.
[A recent GitLab study](https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey/) found a significant perception gap between leadership and individual contributors regarding AI training: 25% of individual contributors said their organizations do not provide adequate training and resources for using AI. In comparison, only 15% of C-level executives felt the same, highlighting a disconnect between how executives and their teams perceive investments in AI training.
This discrepancy underscores the importance of clear communication and alignment between leadership and engineering teams. We are at a crucial time to better align with engineering teams on expectations for the next stage of AI implementation. Leaders must ensure that their vision for AI integration is effectively communicated and that the necessary resources and support are readily available to their teams.
The AI revolution in software development presents both challenges and opportunities. Organizations can navigate this transition successfully and maximize their gains by creating new roles, fostering continuous learning and providing strong leadership. AI is a powerful tool that can enhance human capabilities and drive innovation in software development. As we move forward, the organizations that embrace this change and prepare their teams effectively will be best positioned to thrive in the AI-driven future of software development.
