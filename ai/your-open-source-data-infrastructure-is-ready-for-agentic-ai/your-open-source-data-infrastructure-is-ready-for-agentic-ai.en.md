As engineering leaders race to build agentic AI solutions, many plan big infrastructure buys. Most do not need them. The fully open source data platforms already running their applications can power capable AI agents with targeted upgrades. Particularly for long-term budgets, the strategy should be to extend what you have wherever feasible, not rip and replace.

[Agentic AI](https://thenewstack.io/agentic-ai-is-quickly-revolutionizing-ides-and-developer-productivity/) looks new, but its infrastructure patterns do not. Agents need streaming inputs, durable and scalable storage, low-latency retrieval and elastic compute for model work. These are the same patterns that [Apache Kafka](https://thenewstack.io/the-new-look-and-feel-of-apache-kafka-4-0/), [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/), [Postgres](https://thenewstack.io/postgresql-18-delivers-significant-performance-gains-for-oltp-and-analytics/), [Cassandra](https://thenewstack.io/why-apache-cassandra-5-0-is-a-game-changer-for-developers/) and [OpenSearch](https://thenewstack.io/why-opensearch-3-0-is-your-must-have-upgrade-right-now/) handle every day. The lift is in AI-specific optimizations, not in replacing the stack.

## **Reality Check for Agentic AI**

Agents ingest events, retrieve context, decide, act and learn. That maps cleanly to today’s open source building blocks. Kafka moves events in real time so agents react with context. Kubernetes orchestrates bursty, GPU-hungry workloads without waste. Postgres ([with pgvector!](https://www.instaclustr.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-llm-accuracy-and-performance-with-pgvector-and-postgresql-introduction-to-embeddings-and-the-role-of-pgvector/)) adds vector similarity search for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and semantic lookups. [Cassandra 5.0](https://hackernoon.com/heres-what-to-know-about-apache-cassandra-50https:/hackernoon.com/heres-what-to-know-about-apache-cassandra-50) adds native vector indexing at global scale.

OpenSearch brings vector search into a familiar search and analytics layer. (OpenSearch [k-NN](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/query-dsl/specialized/k-nn/index/) provides vector search through the `knn_vector` field and supports common methods like hierarchical navigable small world or HNSW.) The result is a path to agentic AI that uses platforms your teams already operate.

None of this requires a proprietary “AI-ready” platform, but rather clear patterns and tight interfaces. Keep the infrastructure you know, add vector capabilities where needed and tune [streaming and storage](https://thenewstack.io/store-more-pay-less-welcome-to-kafka-tiered-storage/) for the access patterns of your agents.

## **A Composable Blueprint You Can Build Today**

Call me biased, but composable beats monolithic. Ideally, you want to assemble a minimal set of proven components and scale each on its own curve.

A common blueprint might look like this: Kafka or other streaming lands events from apps, devices and services. A feature store or event processing layer enriches those events. Postgres or Cassandra stores both operational data and embeddings. OpenSearch indexes documents and vectors for fast retrieval. Kubernetes schedules agent services, retrieval workers and model runtimes. Everything is observable and policy-driven.

This approach supports many agent types without rebuilding foundations. A support agent uses the same stream and vector stores as a fraud agent or a document analysis agent. You change prompts, retrieval rules and policies, but you do not change your core infrastructure.

Composable also lowers risk. You can add a pilot agent without needing to mess with critical systems. You can roll back without vendor negotiations and, importantly, you can swap a component when your needs change.

## **Security You Can Audit**

Agents will handle customer data and business-critical decisions, and you need transparency and control. The right open source data layer gives you both. You can audit code paths, enforce policies and prove controls. Kubernetes gives role-based access and network policies; Kafka supports encryption and fine-grained authorization; Postgres and Cassandra provide strong encryption, roles and audit logging; and OpenSearch integrates with common auth providers and access controls.

A zero trust stance fits naturally. Treat every service, model and agent as untrusted by default, enforcing least privilege at every layer. Maintain complete logging and clear visibility into data flows. When you own the stack, you can answer regulators and the board with specifics instead of relying on vendor assurances.

## **Start With a Vertical Slice**

Ideally, before beginning an agentic AI project, you should inventory your stack against the agent life cycle. Depending on which open source data projects you’re already deploying, you might have 70 to 80% of what you need. Then, add vector capabilities where they bring immediate value. Start with the highest-impact retrieval paths and the most common content types.

I’d start by picking one use case that proves the pattern. Good first targets might include customer support retrieval, sales enablement search or internal knowledge assistants. Build a small vertical slice that runs end to end (covering ingestion, retrieval, the agent and one action path). Measure latency, retrieval accuracy and incident rate. Tune and repeat.

Codify security from Day 1 by binding sessions, enforcing authentication between every service and logging retrievals and actions in detail. Define what the agent must never do, and keep humans in the loop where judgment or risk is high.

You can also avoid lock-in by choosing managed services for your open source stack when they make sense, without ceding control to a proprietary platform that dictates your architecture. Always keep your [options open and your data portable](https://thenewstack.io/use-your-data-in-llms-with-the-vector-database-you-already-have/).

## **The Advantage of Being Ready Now**

Agentic AI gets closer in reach when the open source data stack you already have can do much of the heavy lifting. Build on it now to ship faster, spend less and keep control of your data and risk.
