Artificial intelligence. Is there any term that better describes the cloud in 2024 or the enterprise outlook for 2025? According to IDC, global AI spending reached nearly $235 billion in 2024, and now they’re projecting it will hit a jaw-dropping $631 billion by 2028.

AI is already proving it can revolutionize business operations, but there are still many challenges when integrating it and even more when determining user and financial impacts. Topping this is ensuring AI is customized to answer a business’s particular needs and closely monitoring any initiative’s return on investment (ROI). Just as [cloud computing introduced an on-demand scaling](https://thenewstack.io/10-essential-practices-for-building-software-for-cloud-scale/) of resources, AI unveils additional opportunities to automate cost savings and efficiency. However, businesses should consider previous adoption efforts, specifically, choosing deliberate integrations and small-scale improvements vs an all-at-once approach.

Organizations should strive to employ financial operations (FinOps) principles for success in AI adoption. Pragmatic planning and execution of efforts in the AI space are paramount for preventing the ROI deficits that can happen when organizations chase innovation.

**Using FinOps to Align AI **
FinOps is a management approach focused on shared responsibility for cloud computing infrastructure and related costs. Global Market Estimates have reported the FinOps market will increase from $832.2 million in 2023 to more than [$2.75 billion](https://www.globalmarketestimates.com/market-report/cloud-finops-market-4026#:~:text=recent%20market%20numbers-,Global%20Cloud%20FinOps%20Market%20Size,18.8%25%20from%202023%20to%202028.) by 2028. Much of this will be driven by AI’s rapid, global [adoption from enterprise platforms](https://thenewstack.io/short-staffed-digital-adoption-platforms-can-speed-onboarding/) to consumer users.

Companies are attempting to drink from the AI firehose, and unfortunately, they’re creating AI strategies in real-time as they rush to drive revenue and staff productivity. Ideally, you want a foundation in place before using AI in operations. This should include an emphasis on cost management, resource allocation, and keeping tabs on ROI. This is also the focus of FinOps, which can prevent errors and improve processes to further AI adoption.

This foundation can provide an integration roadmap encompassing use cases, promising tools, and a plan for handling implementation.

**Costs and Control**
A survey conducted by Ernst & Young showed that the number of senior business leaders investing $10 million or more in AI will roughly [double in 2025](https://www.ey.com/en_us/newsroom/2024/07/new-ey-research-finds-ai-investment-is-surging-with-senior-leaders-seeing-more-positive-roi-as-hype-continues-to-become-reality). Yet, at the same time, the study points out that many AI investments could be in trouble from the start because they lack the proper infrastructure. This makes implementing effective strategies to manage and control costs vital.

To begin, companies should create a budget and forecast the AI projects they want to take on. This planning is a pillar of FinOps and should accurately assess the total cost of initiatives, emphasizing resource allocation (including staffing) and eliminating billing overruns. Cost optimization can also help [identify opportunities and reduce](https://thenewstack.io/5-ways-opentelemetry-can-reduce-costs/) expenses. The new focus on AI services in the cloud could drive scalability and cost efficiency as they are much more sensitive to overruns and inefficient usage. Even if organizations are not implementing AI into end-user workloads, there is still an opportunity to craft internal systems utilizing AI to help identify [operational efficiencies and implement cost controls on existing infrastructure](https://thenewstack.io/the-engineers-guide-to-controlling-configuration-drift/).

**Pains and Gains**
Analysts from [Forrester](https://investor.forrester.com/news-releases/news-release-details/forrester-unveil-its-2025-tech-leadership-and-artificial) believe enterprises can see long-term success with AI if it’s aligned with business strategy. Chief Information Officers (CIOs) will likely be the ones to champion the scaling of AI most of all, yet they also know demonstrating ROI can be a painful process. With this in mind, consider the following:

**Develop metrics and benchmarks:**This will allow CIOs to assess the impact of AI initiatives;**Show results:**Emphasize operational performance and present findings to the C-suite understandably;**Monitor and analyze:**Follow AI use across the business and detail growth in key areas like customer engagement, sales, efficiency, and savings.**Conduct performance reviews:**Conducting these regularly can generate data highlighting where AI has a positive impact and where it’s failing.
FinOps practices can deliver greater financial visibility into AI investments, fortifying decision-making and maximizing ROI. With enhanced strategies to control [costs and resource allocation](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-gain-visibility-into-kubernetes-cost-allocation/), businesses can easily overcome the complexities that stifle AI adoption while proving gains and winning further buy-in from decision-makers.
