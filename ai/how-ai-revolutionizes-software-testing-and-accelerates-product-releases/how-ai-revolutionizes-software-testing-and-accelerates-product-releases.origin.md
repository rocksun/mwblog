For the past few decades, software testers have relied on their coding skills to create high-quality programs that sell. The main problem with this method was that it would take years to release, mainly because[ human oversight would often cause delays](https://thenewstack.io/bridging-the-ai-human-divide-ai-as-your-operations-teammate/). To speed up the process, companies introduced [automation](https://thenewstack.io/automation-all-fun-and-games-until-something-goes-wrong/); however, it still required significant human involvement to generate the tests, which could also be prone to error.

By bringing AI into the equation, software developers have [gained an extra helping mind](https://thenewstack.io/new-ebook-how-generative-ai-transforms-software-development/) — a faster one that can easily browse vast amounts of data. These algorithms are trained to identify patterns and analyze results, leading to more comprehensive reports. This has significantly reduced the resources and time needed to conduct software tests, leading to faster product releases.

## How AI Testing Shortens the Product Release Timeline
Adding AI to software can significantly speed up the time until a product can reach the market. This is done by improving accuracy, efficiency, and test activity coverage. Below are some ways in which AI-driven testing can do this:

### Improves Test Automation and Execution
Each software project will require numerous test cases throughout its development cycle, and their generation will demand valuable time from human testers. This can be especially problematic if multiple tests are needed daily, each with its specifications for the ever-changing product. Generative AI used within testing efforts can offer a test script within seconds, as the system implements it automatically to ensure continuity.

Moreover, unlike human intelligence, which eventually requires rest to maintain performance, AI can offer around-the-clock operations. These tools can ensure the software is tested even outside working hours, reducing the time necessary to release the product to the market.

### Offers Broader Test Coverage
Software products, especially those owned by larger companies, must be tested across different scenarios. In the introduction stage, one or two scenarios are often applied to ensure viability. However, as the product advances within its lifecycle, more scenarios will be required — and therefore, broader test coverage will be needed.

Human intelligence may have limitations in this matter, not only due to time constraints but also because of the available knowledge and expertise. On the other hand, AI tools are trained to know more and remember better. This way, they tap into larger data volumes, identifying critical scenarios that may have been missed in manual testing. As all categories of scenarios are detected early on, developers use this to plan a faster release to the market.

An example is how[ Apple used generative AI](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p) to improve software testing, writing different scenarios to ensure efficiency. This helped them revamp their software within weeks or months instead of taking years. Used together with human intelligence, this helps eager buyers get their hands on their favorite products much faster.

### Enables Faster Bug Detection
Bugs and anomalies within the code are some of the main reasons why release delays often occur.[ Microsoft delayed the release](https://www.crn.com/news/security/170702468/microsoft-delay-of-patch-underscores-slow-fix-process) of an underscore patch for 30 days, mainly because a potentially dangerous bug was revealed a short time before the release. Had this issue been discovered and addressed faster, the delay could have been prevented, and the patch would have reached the market sooner.

AI tools have shown great potential in making that happen. Aside from early detection of a potentially problematic bug, such algorithms also analyze the root cause. This way, steps can be taken to fix and prevent the problem from reappearing later in development. Products can reach the market faster by removing the need to fix bugs repeatedly.

For instance, Google[ implemented the Deepmind AI-based system](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/ai-google-deepmind-artificla-intelligence-geometry-b2480289.html) to test complex games for potential bugs. Such games would typically take years to be thoroughly tested, but the AI-driven system helped speed up development by several years. Testing environments were also made easily accessible, improving testers’ productivity and efficiency.

### Ensures Appropriate Use of Data-Driven Insights
Some products require data-driven insights to “sculpt” the perfect piece of software into being. For instance, many software developers prefer releasing a beta product before publishing the final one to gain actionable insight. Based on the user feedback, they can narrow down the pain points and make an informed decision about the final product.

When only a dozen or so users are testing the product, human intelligence and regular automation can easily handle the process. However, if hundreds of users are present, all with different types of feedback, it can be challenging to determine the problems. AI testing tools can summarize that data, predicting the areas with the highest potential for issues. This can effectively reduce delays, improving the time to market.

### Improves Test Maintenance Process
One thing you need to know about software testing is that no program remains constantly effective. While it may have worked well in the beginning, the evolution of the application could cause several old commands to crash, rendering it ineffective. Identifying the issue and continuously maintaining the test could use essential company resources, leading to delays that otherwise prevent a fast release.

For instance, Netflix used an ML-driven method called “Kayenta,” an[ automated canary release](https://netflixtechblog.com/automated-canary-analysis-at-netflix-with-kayenta-3260bc7acc69) that monitors how users respond to changes. Should it potentially downgrade the experience, the company stops it before it reaches the entire user base.

AI-driven testing frameworks are often self-healing and can detect and adapt to potential changes within an application. Their ability to update test scripts automatically can keep older tests valid for longer, reducing the burden caused by maintenance. This helps reduce time to market, allowing you to bring a faster profit.

By leveraging AI in software testing, software developers can find potential issues much faster, preventing time-consuming bugs from causing unwanted delays. Automation and the ability to scan through vast amounts of data within seconds also add to those efforts. This way, a company can release a high-quality software product in a much shorter time.
