Most organizations are ending 2025 with tangible AI wins. Developers are shipping code faster, costs are down and leadership is thrilled that everyone is [embracing AI](https://thenewstack.io/ai-has-won-googles-dora-study-shows-universal-dev-adoption/).

Congratulations. You’re about to face a whole new set of problems. The decisions you make about scaling, [governance](https://thenewstack.io/governance-as-code-your-infrastructures-missing-guardrail/) and strategic integration in 2026 will make a crucial difference to how your organization performs in the coming years.

Get it right, and the gains you’ve seen in the past year will compound. Get it wrong, and your growth will plateau or worse.

Let’s look at three trends enabling organizations to use AI for sustained growth and business transformation in 2026: AI governance, end-to-end [agentic systems](https://thenewstack.io/beyond-scripts-the-shift-from-automation-to-agentic-ai/) and [data context](https://thenewstack.io/the-real-bottleneck-in-enterprise-ai-isnt-the-model-its-context/).

## The Shadow AI Conundrum

At some point in the coming year, your CFO will probably ask why your cloud costs have skyrocketed, and you’ll discover that three different teams built competing agentic AI solutions to solve the same problem.

The paradox is that this spirit of experimentation is exactly what’s driving AI adoption and the discovery of successful solutions. But as teams spin up ad hoc solutions from development tools, cloud platforms and countless other sources, the lack of centralized oversight becomes an issue that you can’t afford to ignore. All of these agents will increase cloud and compute costs.

Organizations need to refine the way they measure ROI to understand how their AI investments are actually performing. They will need to implement governance [platforms that track which agents](https://thenewstack.io/agentic-ai-the-missing-piece-in-platform-engineering/) are running, the resources they consume, the business value they deliver and how they interact with each other and with critical systems.

Governance is always a trade-off. [Developers still need the ability to experiment](https://thenewstack.io/the-genai-data-developer-experience-performance-optimization/) with new AI tools. But the most successful organizations will find the right balance between AI innovation and governance.

## The Shift to Enterprise Agents

The organizations that win the next phase of the AI race will be those that spend the coming year building AI agents to handle complex, multistep processes, not just to address ad hoc opportunities.

For example, many companies have found that AI-assisted coding has made their developers 10 times more productive. If that’s you, congratulations! But also, look around: Your [security and compliance teams](https://thenewstack.io/3-ways-security-teams-can-tame-autonomous-ai-agents/) are probably looking at a giant backlog of reviews for all that code. And your sales and finance teams might still be waiting weeks for legal review on contracts that an agentic AI system could have flagged on Day 1.

In 2026, organizations should begin implementing agentic systems that manage end-to-end processes, such as overseeing the B2B sales cycle or coordinating product delivery from the warehouse to the doorstep.

Crucially, these agents should serve as connective tissue between teams, handling the administrative work and streamlining review cycles that can create bottlenecks.

## Data Context Is Everything

Your AI is only as smart as the data it can access. Right now, critical context is spread across different systems that don’t talk to each other. AI might be able to write flawless Python code, but if it can’t access design decisions recorded in a wiki, compliance requirements buried in a Slack thread and a customer data model that exists only in the company’s customer relationship management (CRM) solution, the code might be technically correct but strategically useless.

The challenge is that business data typically resides across countless disconnected systems, making it largely inaccessible. That fragmented data landscape is the primary barrier preventing companies from [unlocking the full potential of AI](https://thenewstack.io/ctos-hold-the-key-to-unlocking-ais-innovation-potential/). To address it, companies will need to build data architectures that can support the AI investments they’re already making.

If you prioritize building unified data and context frameworks, you’ll benefit from faster deployments of AI and agentic systems and reduced security risk. And that context will give you the power to leverage organizational knowledge across your entire technology stack.

## Reimaging? Or Just Automating?

The gap between AI leaders and followers in 2026 comes down to this question: Are you reimagining the way work gets done, or are you just finding ways to automate the old ways?

Strategic advantage in AI comes from systematically integrating agentic capabilities into core business operations, rather than allowing disparate teams to address point solutions haphazardly.

The organizations that pull ahead over the next year will be the ones that build the proper foundation. Implement governance that enables experimentation. [Build agents that connect teams](https://thenewstack.io/what-nobody-tells-you-about-building-and-retaining-genai-teams/), not just automate tasks. Unify your data architecture. Accomplish these three things, and you will compound your 2025 gains into lasting competitive advantage.
