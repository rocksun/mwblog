In today’s highly digital world, we generate tons of data daily — [over 3.5 quintillion bytes](https://wpdevshed.com/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/), to be more precise. To make sense of all this data and glean meaningful insights from it, we need a way to efficiently search and analyze vast amounts of information.

Whether it’s finding similar images, recommending products, or understanding complex patterns in high-dimensional data, the importance of advanced database systems cannot be understated. This is where vector databases shine. They provide [an effective and efficient solution](https://thenewstack.io/vector-databases-are-having-a-moment-a-chat-with-pinecone/) for storing and retrieving vector data quickly and accurately.

In this article, we’ll explore the world of vector databases and look at the 10 best contenders revolutionizing machine learning and similarity search. In addition, we’ll tackle open source vector databases in particular.

## What Is a Vector Database?
Vector databases are a special type of database designed to organize data based on similarities. They do this by converting raw data, such as images, text, video, or audio, into mathematical representations [known as high-dimensional vectors](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/high-dimensional-stats-r/01-introduction-to-high-dimensional-data/index.html). Each vector can contain anywhere from tens to thousands of dimensions, depending on the complexity of the raw data.

Vector databases [excel at quickly identifying](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/) similar data items. In today’s data-driven world, they have lots of applications, such as suggesting similar products in online stores, finding similar images on the internet, or recommending similar videos on streaming sites. Vector databases can also be used to identify similar genetic sequences in biology, detect fraud in the finance industry, or analyze sensor data from IoT-enabled devices.

## How Do Vector Databases Work?
Vector databases store and manage data as high-dimensional vectors, enabling efficient similarity searches across massive datasets. Each data point (e.g., an image, document, or user profile) is transformed into a fixed-length numerical vector using machine learning models like embeddings from deep learning networks.

Instead of exact matches, vector databases focus on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms, [such as HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)](https://thenewstack.io/vector-search-what-you-need-to-know-before-getting-started/) or IVF (Inverted File Index). These algorithms reduce search complexity by organizing data into clusters or graphs, drastically improving query speed for large datasets.

When a query is made, it’s converted into a vector, and the database searches for vectors with minimal distance metrics (like [cosine similarity](https://towardsdatascience.com/cosine-similarity-how-does-it-measure-the-similarity-maths-behind-and-usage-in-python-50ad30aad7db/), Euclidean, or dot product) to return the closest matches. This makes vector databases ideal for applications like recommendation systems, image recognition, natural language processing, and anomaly detection, where semantic similarity is more important than exact matching.
