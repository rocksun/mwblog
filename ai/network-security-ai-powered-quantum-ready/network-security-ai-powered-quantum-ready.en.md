The current pace of digital innovation is rendering traditional approaches to security obsolete. In the past, organizations responded to each new challenge by introducing a new point solution, which inevitably required a new project. Point solutions led to new projects, again and again. The patchwork of tools that emerged as a result created operational chaos and security gaps, and most importantly, it made it difficult for companies to adopt new technologies.

Whether it’s AI-powered innovation or new risks emerging from quantum computing, our vision is to help our customers embrace innovation and stay ahead of emerging threats. We’re achieving this by consolidating fragmented defenses into a single, intelligent platform: the [Strata Network Security Platform](/network-security). This unified, AI-powered approach is the only way to simplify operations, continuously adapt defenses and deliver the agility to respond to “what’s next.”

## New workspace

## Transform Your Browser into a Protected Enterprise Workspace

According to Omdia, today [85% of work](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/omdia-state-of-workforce-security), including the use of GenAI, copilots and SaaS applications, takes place within a browser. This shift exposes a staggering risk, with the same study finding that *95% of organizations report experiencing a browser-based attack.*

#### Secure the new workspace on all devices and all traffic.

Consumer browsers were not built for enterprise security. Evasive threats often go undetected inline, undecryptable threats slip through, work on unmanaged devices remains exposed, and organizations are forced into poor-experience workarounds like VDI.

[Prisma Browser](/sase/prisma-browser) redefines work anywhere, on all devices (managed and unmanaged). As the first *SASE-native, enterprise-class secure browser* it enables organizations to secure the new workspace:

* **Stop Evasive Attacks Before They Execute** – Block attacks that execute in the browser and zero-day exploits, including malicious extensions. Protect all web traffic without the need to decrypt.
* **Safely Enable Employees’ access to GenAI and SaaS Use** – Gain full visibility into all GenAI and SaaS applications in use, understand associated risks, and enforce access governance.
* **Leverage AI-Powered Data Security** – Bring precise, LLM-augmented data classification directly into the browser, safeguarding sensitive data in use at the last mile with granular controls.

Prisma Browser complements existing SASE controls, securing the AI-powered workspace while enabling enterprises to work safely anywhere, on any device, and across all web traffic, without sacrificing performance or user experience.

## Secure Your AI Ecosystem with Unprecedented Clarity

The adoption of AI and autonomous agents is poised to fundamentally redefine business. IDC projects an estimated [1.3 billion](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/blog/article/ai-apps-and-agents-marketplace) enterprise AI agents will be in production by 2028. However, the AI revolution introduces critical risks, including prompt injection attacks, model vulnerabilities and malicious agent behavior.

#### **Discover, assess and protect every part of your AI ecosystem.**

To close these blind spots, we launched [Prisma® AIRS 2.0 ™](/prisma/prisma-ai-runtime-security), the world’s most comprehensive AI security platform. Prisma AIRS secures the entire enterprise AI ecosystem across applications, agents, models and data:

* **Discover** every traditional AI component across multi- and hybrid-cloud environments.
* **Assess** AI risks using AI Model Security, AI Red Teaming and AI Posture Management.
* **Protect** deployments with AI Runtime Security and AI Agent Security, which stop prompt injections, tool misuse and malicious agent behavior in real-time.

## Accelerate Your Path to Quantum-Safe Security

Quantum computing is no longer a risk in the distant future. Experts' predictions vary regarding when quantum computing will arrive, but when it does, it will render traditional cryptography obsolete. Migrating cryptography across all your apps, infrastructure, and devices could take years, and governments, including the U.S., are already acting with federal mandates beginning this year.

#### **Begin your journey to quantum-readiness today.**

Palo Alto Networks helps customers stay ahead of government mandates and risks with a simple, practical approach:

* **Discover** your cryptographic inventory across your environment with Quantum Readiness.
* **Deploy** quantum-ready, next-generation firewalls, leveraging the latest version of PAN-OS, that deliver post-quantum cryptography (PQC) decryption at scale
* **Accelerate** the upgrade of internal applications and IoT/OT devices to quantum-safe status instantly, without downtime, using Cipher Translation technology.

## Leverage Unified Management for End-to-End Efficacy

If you are already a customer, it’s simple to deploy these new innovations. All of these breakthroughs (Prisma Browser, Prisma AIRS and an easy path to quantum-readiness) are seamlessly integrated into the Strata Network Security Platform.

#### **Manage your entire defense simply and effectively.**

This platform is anchored by [**Strata Cloud Manager**](/network-security/strata-cloud-manager), the industry's first, AI-powered Unified Management and Operations Solution. This single tool provides comprehensive visibility and control across your entire SASE and Next-Generation Firewall estate. This simplification is the key to achieving the agility and efficacy required to secure what’s next.
