The leading cause of friction and time waste for engineering teams is not tech debt, testing or code reviews, but finding information.

This unexpected but revealing insight comes from Atlassian’s “[State of Developer Experience 2025](https://www.atlassian.com/teams/software-development/state-of-developer-experience-2025)” report. Finding information has overtaken [technical debt](https://thenewstack.io/how-frontend-devs-can-take-technical-debt-out-of-code/), which topped the list last year, as the top source of developer friction. The key finding from surveying 3,500 developers and managers is:

While more development teams perceive they’re gaining more time from AI, they’re also reporting greater organizational inefficiencies than before.

According to the report, over 50% of developers lose more than 10 hours per week to [organizational inefficiencies](https://thenewstack.io/why-do-developers-lose-1-day-a-week-to-inefficiencies/). Even more concerning: 90% lose at least six hours weekly. And while 68% developers report 10+ hours of weekly time savings due to the use of [AI tools](https://thenewstack.io/ai-tools-now-essential-in-java-devs-productivity-arsenal/), much of that gain is offset by friction outside the code editor.

This just confirms that [throwing AI at developers won’t solve their problems](https://thenewstack.io/throwing-ai-at-developers-wont-fix-their-problems/). Despite all the investment in tooling and AI, developers are still wasting the most time simply trying to locate what they need to do their jobs.

## The Hidden Cause of Developer Friction

The real problem isn’t that developers don’t have enough tools. According to the same report, the second and third causes of friction are new issues, and both are related to increasing complexity and cognitive load: new technology and switching context between tools.

Developers’ workflows are fragmented, knowledge is siloed and coordination work is eating away at the time teams want to spend actually building software.

Talk to any engineer long enough and you’ll hear the same complaints:

1. **Fragmented developer experience**: Developers must navigate multiple disconnected tools, platforms and knowledge bases.
2. **Knowledge discovery challenges**: Finding relevant documentation, code examples and best practices is time-consuming and often frustrating.
3. **Limited self-service capabilities**: Many operations require tickets or assistance from specialized teams, creating bottlenecks.
4. **Inconsistent standards enforcement**: Ensuring compliance with organizational standards for security, quality and architecture is difficult to automate and enforce.
5. **Cognitive overload**: The increasing complexity of development environments places a heavy cognitive burden on developers, reducing productivity and satisfaction.
6. **Reduced accountability**: It’s unclear who owns what and who to call when something goes wrong. Site reliability engineers (SREs) are sometimes on call for services they don’t know anything about and they don’t know who owns them. Similarly, when security or customer support needs to file a ticket, they don’t know who to assign it to.

## **When an IDP Falls Short**

Internal developer portals (IDPs) are often hailed as the go-to solution for these pain points, and even this year’s Atlassian report highlights adopting an IDP as a must for improving the developer experience.

Developer portals are useful for org-wide visibility, but are difficult to maintain and require a lot of investment to get started. From our conversations with organizations, many have failed to adopt them for this reason. The IDPs that are successful were created by organizations that spent many years building them.

Also, teams and tools change frequently, and AI is just accelerating that. Things end up orphaned or incorrectly owned. Eventually, teams are playing hot potato, trying to find the right person. This is a death spiral — the less useful the information, the less likely a portal will be used, reducing the incentives to maintain it.

## **A Self-Managed Teams Portal**

That’s why we are building [Aviator Teams](https://www.aviator.co/teams?utm_source=tns&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=q2-2025-tns-article-5-teams&utm_term=net-new&utm_content=awareness), a central hub for all development activities within an organization. It combines the organizational benefits of traditional IDPs with the intelligence and contextual awareness provided by AI.

The goal is simple: reduce the time developers spend finding information so they can spend it using that information to [build](https://www.aviator.co/merge-queue?utm_source=tns&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=q2-2025-tns-article-5-merge-queue&utm_term=net-new&utm_content=awareness), [review](https://www.aviator.co/flexreview?utm_source=tns&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=q2-2025-tns-article-5-flex-review&utm_term=net-new&utm_content=awareness) and [ship](https://www.aviator.co/releases?utm_source=tns&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=q2-2025-tns-article-5-releases&utm_term=net-new&utm_content=awareness).

We’d love to hear your feedback on what we’re building.

Together we can design a better developer experience from the ground up.
