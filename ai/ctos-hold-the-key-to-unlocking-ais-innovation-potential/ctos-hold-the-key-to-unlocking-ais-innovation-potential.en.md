Development leaders have witnessed firsthand how AI has fundamentally reshaped the innovation landscape. Recent data now demonstrates the massive scale of this transformation.

AI-powered software innovation is generating savings of more than $28,000 per developer annually, according to [GitLab’s 2025 survey of C-suite executives](https://about.gitlab.com/software-innovation-report/), which surveyed thousands of C-level executives worldwide. Applying this to the world’s 27 million developers means that AI has the potential to unlock more than $750 billion in global value annually.

Given these substantial savings, it’s no wonder C-suite leaders are on board with AI’s potential to drive greater efficiency in software innovation. Nine out of 10 executives (91%) say that software innovation is now a core business priority for their organization.

## **Moving From AI Aspiration to a Human-AI Partnership**

Significant growth potential remains untapped. While executives aspire to build human-AI partnerships that split software development work 50-50, the majority report that AI is currently only handling about 25% of the work. To successfully drive [AI adoption among development teams](https://thenewstack.io/what-pair-programming-can-show-us-about-implementing-ai/), leaders must effectively communicate and frame its value, connecting development activities to business outcomes by focusing on problem-solving capabilities and direct business impact rather than code volume. This shift in thinking will be critical to fully realizing AI’s potential.

AI isn’t eliminating developer jobs. However, it is fundamentally changing what those jobs require and how executives need to lead and structure teams to capitalize on this massive opportunity.

Companies that grasp the value of AI demonstrate three critical traits: They have the right CTO strategy with a relentless customer focus; they’re applying [platform thinking to enable their teams to scale more effectively](https://thenewstack.io/accelerating-developer-velocity-with-effective-platform-teams/) with AI; and they’re investing in team structures and upskilling to help their developers reap the benefits of AI.

## **Embrace Strategic Technical Leadership**

With 82% of C-suite leaders willing to invest over half of their IT budgets in software innovation, this moment presents an opportunity for technical leaders to shine. I’ve found throughout my career that CTOs come in several different styles, and companies need varying styles of technical leadership at different points in their evolution. Three distinct CTO styles emerge: Builder, Strategist and Guardian.

Builder CTOs demonstrate excellence in innovating with AI, establishing core technical architecture, and developing innovative products, all while constantly validating their assumptions with customer feedback. These leaders prove ideal for smaller, high-growth companies and those that are earlier in their AI journeys.

Strategist CTOs thrive when companies mature, combining deep technical acumen and business knowledge to build platforms, develop long-term visions, cultivate strategic partnerships and position the company for long-term, scalable growth. These leaders can help transform AI into a permanent, value-additive component of the company’s strategic platform.

Guardian CTOs excel at helping companies with complex IT infrastructures and large customer bases maintain stability, security and operational efficiency. These leaders represent the right fit for companies whose priorities include implementing governance and security measures around AI, as well as establishing AI processes and standards to maximize efficiency and cost savings.

Success in AI-powered software innovation requires leadership that can identify targeted AI applications, translate them into customer value and enable teams to focus on higher-value work.

## Champion Platform Thinking for Scalability

As organizations grow, teams specialize in focusing on specific challenges, but with more teams, coordination among them can become inefficient. Once an organization reaches enterprise scale, those divisions often turn into silos that can hinder effective collaboration among humans and prevent the organization from realizing the benefits of [human-AI collaboration](https://thenewstack.io/50-50-the-future-of-human-ai-collaboration-for-innovation/).

The most effective CTOs implement platform-based approaches to set their companies up for [scalable growth without creating silos](https://thenewstack.io/creating-a-strategic-roadmap-for-effective-ai-implementation/). The predominant strategy involves establishing a centralized team that’s responsible for [building a platform](https://thenewstack.io/platform-teams-adopt-these-7-developer-productivity-drivers/) that product teams across the organization can use. This team’s primary purpose is to automate mundane tasks and deliver streamlined workflows for all software innovation teams throughout the organization, a role that AI can enhance.

CTOs may need to establish specialized teams to support a complicated subsystem required by the rest of the organization. An organization with complex needs, such as evaluating fraud risk in new customers or solving supply-chain complexities in real time, might create a team dedicated to supporting this as an AI-powered “subsystem” that the rest of the company can use.

## Transform Team Structure and Skills To Maximize Humans

Preparing software teams for success in the AI era means allowing humans to focus on tasks that AI cannot perform effectively. While AI assists with many software development tasks like coding, it cannot define the “why” behind a project.

Engineers who can translate business needs into technical solutions and anticipate future trends will be invaluable. Those who can combine technical skills with critical thinking skills will be positioned to guide AI technologies and realize the productivity gains of human-AI partnerships.

Training in specific AI-related skills, such as prompt engineering and data management, will be crucial. The most valuable human contributions will be creativity, strategic vision and collaboration.

However, a notable perception gap requires attention. A recent [GitLab DevSecOps report](https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey/) found that 25% of individual contributors reported that their organizations don’t provide adequate AI training, compared to only 15% of C-level executives who shared the same sentiment.

Forward-thinking CTOs will frame upskilling as an investment in the human-AI partnership that will deliver competitive advantages.

## Human Innovation Remains Central to Future Success

The $750 billion value proposition represented by AI-powered software innovation won’t materialize automatically. Capitalizing on AI’s potential requires effective leadership, platform thinking and upskilling in a way that enables humans to focus on their strengths while allowing AI to manage and automate mundane tasks.

AI continues to [reshape the software development landscape](https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-is-reshaping-the-software-development-life-cycle/), but it doesn’t eliminate the need for skilled engineers. Instead, it redirects focus toward higher-value work that requires human judgment, ingenuity and strategic thinking. Over time, human software innovators will concentrate increasingly on the work that drives competitive advantage. Organizations that embrace AI-powered innovation can then transform themselves and their industries in unprecedented ways.
