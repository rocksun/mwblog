The open source [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) represents a milestone in [large language model](https://thenewstack.io/llm/) (LLM) serving technology, providing developers with a fast, flexible and production-ready inference engine.

Initially developed in the [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, this library has evolved into a community-driven project that addresses the critical challenges of memory management, throughput optimization and scalable deployment in LLM applications. The library’s innovative approach to attention mechanisms and memory allocation has established it as a leading solution for organizations seeking to deploy LLMs efficiently at scale.

vLLM’s rapid growth as a foundational technology in the AI inference ecosystem is strongly backed by major industry players, most notably [Red Hat](https://www.openshift.com/try?utm_content=inline+mention). Red Hat has [integrated](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-unlocks-generative-ai-any-model-and-any-accelerator-across-hybrid-cloud-red-hat-ai-inference-server) vLLM at the core of its AI Inference Server, based on OpenShift. Integration between OpenShift and vLLM is accomplished through OpenShift AI’s model serving platform, which leverages [KServe](https://github.com/kserve/kserve) for deploying and managing AI models at scale.

[llm-d](https://llm-d.ai/), an open source project recently launched by Google and Red Hat, is powered by vLLM’s highly efficient inference engine, enabling distributed, Kubernetes-native LLM serving at scale.
## Core Architecture and Key Features
### PagedAttention Mechanism
The cornerstone of vLLM’s performance advantage lies in its [PagedAttention](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html) algorithm, which fundamentally reimagines how key-value (KV) cache memory is managed during inference. Unlike traditional approaches that allocate contiguous memory blocks, PagedAttention partitions the KV cache into fixed-size blocks that can be stored in noncontiguous memory locations. This design, inspired by operating system virtual memory techniques, enables efficient memory sharing and significantly reduces fragmentation.

The PagedAttention system maintains block tables that map logical KV blocks to physical memory blocks for each request, providing flexibility in memory allocation while ensuring optimal GPU utilization. When processing sequences, the algorithm computes attention scores using a block-wise approach, dividing key and value vectors into fixed-size blocks for efficient memory management and computation. This approach allows vLLM to handle dynamic sequence lengths without the memory waste associated with traditional padding techniques.

### Continuous Batching and Dynamic Scheduling
vLLM implements continuous batching, also known as dynamic batching or iteration-level scheduling, which operates at the granularity of individual generation steps rather than entire sequences. This approach eliminates the head-of-line blocking problem inherent in static batching systems, where fast-completing requests must wait for slower ones to finish. The system maintains a request queue and dynamically composes batches at each forward pass, adding new requests to currently running batches when capacity allows.

The continuous batching mechanism offers several critical advantages, including increased throughput through constant [GPU utilization](https://thenewstack.io/developers-can-now-uber-gpus-with-nvidias-lepton-platform/), reduced average latency as requests are processed immediately and improved resource utilization by minimizing idle time. When sequences complete generation, their resources are immediately freed and made available for new requests in the next processing step.

### Advanced Optimization Features
vLLM incorporates multiple optimization techniques that enhance performance across diverse deployment scenarios, including CPUs and GPUs. The system supports various quantization methods, including GPTQ, AWQ, INT4, INT8 and FP8, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained environments. [Speculative decoding](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1697318534555336961) capabilities allow the system to generate potential future tokens proactively, reducing latency in interactive applications.

The library implements chunked prefill functionality, which enables efficient processing of long input sequences by breaking them into manageable chunks. This feature is particularly valuable for applications requiring extensive context windows or document processing capabilities. Additionally, vLLM supports optimized CUDA kernels by integrating FlashAttention and FlashInfer, providing hardware-specific optimizations for maximum performance.

## Model Compatibility and Support
### Supported Model Architectures
vLLM provides extensive compatibility with popular model architectures through seamless integration with Hugging Face [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index). The system supports generative and pooling models across various tasks, with users able to specify the task via command-line arguments. For models not natively supported, vLLM offers compatibility through its Transformers backend, enabling the use of custom models before they receive official support.

The library maintains broad support for decoder-based language models, with ongoing development for vision-language model capabilities. Custom model integration is facilitated through well-documented APIs that allow developers to extend vLLM’s functionality for specialized architectures. The system automatically detects compatible models and can force the use of specific implementations when needed.

### Hardware Platform Support
vLLM’s hardware compatibility spans multiple vendors and architectures, supporting NVIDIA GPUs, AMD CPUs and GPUs, Intel CPUs, Gaudi accelerators, IBM Power CPUs, TPUs and AWS Trainium and Inferentia Accelerators. The quantization compatibility matrix demonstrates comprehensive support across hardware platforms, though some methods are optimized for specific GPU generations.

NVIDIA GPU support ranges from older Volta architectures to the latest Hopper systems, with different quantization methods optimized for specific compute capabilities. AMD GPU support includes compatibility with modern RDNA architectures, while Intel GPU support provides options for diverse deployment environments. This broad hardware compatibility enables organizations to leverage existing infrastructure while maintaining optimal performance characteristics.

## Deployment Options and Integration
### Container-Based Deployment
vLLM offers comprehensive [Docker support](https://thenewstack.io/containers-in-the-age-of-ai-a-chat-with-new-docker-president-mark-cavage/) through [official container images](https://hub.docker.com/u/vllm) available on Docker Hub. The primary container image, vllm/vllm-openai, provides a complete OpenAI-compatible server environment that can be deployed across various container orchestration platforms. Container deployment supports GPU acceleration through [NVIDIA Container Runtime](https://developer.nvidia.com/container-runtime), with proper shared memory configuration for tensor parallel operations.

Custom container builds are supported for organizations requiring specific dependencies or configurations. The Docker images can be extended with additional layers to meet specialized requirements, such as audio processing capabilities or development versions of transformers. Container deployment simplifies the process of moving from development to production environments while maintaining consistency across different deployment targets.

### Kubernetes and Production Orchestration
[Kubernetes deployment](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/) is fully supported through comprehensive YAML configurations and Helm charts. The deployment process requires the NVIDIA [Kubernetes Device Plugin](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/k8s-device-plugin) for GPU resource management and proper persistent volume configuration for model caching. vLLM’s Kubernetes integration supports horizontal scaling through replica management and service discovery through standard Kubernetes networking.
The vLLM production stack offers enterprise-grade deployment capabilities, including upstream compatibility, simplified deployment via Helm charts and integrated observability through [Grafana dashboards](https://thenewstack.io/grafana-11-no-need-to-create-promql-queries-for-prometheus/). This production-oriented approach includes features like multimodel support, model-aware routing, fast bootstrapping and KV cache offloading capabilities. The production stack is designed for LLM workloads with optimization for high-performance scenarios.

### API Compatibility and Integration
vLLM provides an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server that implements standard completions and chat APIs, enabling seamless integration with existing applications. The server supports all major OpenAI API endpoints, including completions, chat completions, embeddings and audio transcriptions, with additional custom endpoints for tokenization, pooling and scoring. Extra parameters beyond the OpenAI specification can be passed through the extra_body parameter for enhanced functionality.

The API server supports streaming responses for real-time applications, with token-by-token output generation that enhances user experience in interactive scenarios. Authentication is handled through API keys, and the server can be configured with various model-specific parameters, including generation configs and sampling parameters. Integration with popular HTTP clients and the official OpenAI Python library is straightforward and well-documented.
