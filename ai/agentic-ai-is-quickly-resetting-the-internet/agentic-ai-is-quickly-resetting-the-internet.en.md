The internet, as we know it, is undergoing a reset in how it’s used and what is expected of it. For decades, we’ve measured Internet performance using metrics such as bandwidth, speed, and uptime. But the emergence of agentic AI — autonomous software agents capable of making decisions and executing tasks on our behalf — is ushering in an era where those metrics are no longer enough. As AI agents become Internet “users” alongside humans, they are introducing a new standard for the networks and data they rely on.

For enterprises, this means a fundamental shift in mindset. It’s not about buying more bandwidth or faster servers, but about orchestrating an entire ecosystem of validated data, resilient service paths, and dynamic capacity, all to meet the demands of intelligent agents that never sleep and never slow down.

As AI agents take their place as ‘digital citizens,’ acting, deciding, and transacting at machine speed, the challenge is to ensure that the network, the data, and the services it delivers are up to the task. With this transformation, critical metrics to assuring performance and accuracy will include: validation of data quality, resilience, and the evolution of capacity planning.

## **Validating Data Quality as a Function of Trust**

In the era of agentic AI, the quality of data is a critical necessity. AI agents depend on data feeds to make decisions and automate processes. If the data is incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate, the consequences can be significant, from misinformed business actions to financial losses.

Consider a financial services AI agent tasked with validating transactions in real time across multiple banking systems. If even a single data feed is delayed or corrupted, the result could be halted trades, compliance failures, or even missed fraud detection. To execute on such complex actions requires not just more data, but better data. To trust automated agent action, enterprises will need to know not just what the data is, but where it came from, and whether it can be trusted.

## **Ensuring Resilience Across Exponential Interdependencies**

For years, network operators and enterprises have tracked Internet performance through metrics like uptime and availability. As agentic AI systems coordinate complex, interdependent workflows, spanning dozens or hundreds of external APIs and services, resilience and uptime will become ever more critical, and ever more complex.

Unlike conventional services that follow predetermined workflows, many modern AI agents are designed to dynamically determine their own paths to accomplish tasks. In complex enterprise environments, this can result in exponentially more intricate dependency webs compared to traditional service architectures.

The number of data sources that an agent will tap into may vary from action to action. The agent is focused on producing an answer to a specific prompt: the path it takes to get there will vary, and it’s not going to be possible for an agent’s designers to monitor, validate or manage the performance using single-point metrics.

Imagine an AI-driven fraud detection system that must aggregate information from multiple sources, in real time, to flag suspicious transactions. Any single point of failure, a slow API, a quota issue, or a transient network outage, can cause cascading disruptions, potentially leaving the entire detection process compromised.

In such an interdependent architecture, latency becomes mission-critical too. For agentic AI, delays of even a few milliseconds can mean missed opportunities or failed operations, especially in sectors like finance or real-time compliance.

## **End-to-End Capacity Planning, Rethinking What ‘Enough’ Means**

In the traditional internet paradigm, capacity planning was a matter of ensuring enough bandwidth or compute to meet demand. But in the world of agentic AI, capacity must be viewed as an end-to-end, service delivery chain, encompassing not just raw connectivity, but the entire route from data source to agent, through all the validation, payment gateways, and edge computing nodes along the way.

Take a bank’s backend system as an example. To support thousands of customer queries and regulatory checks per second, it’s no longer enough to simply buy more bandwidth. The bank must optimize every link in its service delivery chain, modelling usage patterns, predicting demand spikes, and ensuring that no single bottleneck (even one halfway across the world) can slow down the entire process.

Dynamic, predictive scaling is the new watchword. Just as streaming platforms like Netflix pre-load popular content to edge servers based on anticipated demand, organizations will need to pre-fetch or dynamically allocate resources for AI agent workflows to ensure seamless performance, even during unexpected surges.

## **New Metrics for a New Internet**

If the internet’s architecture has always been inherently resilient, what’s changed is how we use it and what we expect from it. AI agents will drive a shift from basic uptime and bandwidth to a focus on data quality, service resilience, and end-to-end assurance.

Organizations will need to start measuring entirely new performance indicators: data freshness and provenance tracking, multi-source validation rates, agent workflow completion times, and cross-service dependency health scores. Forward-thinking enterprises are likely to move beyond traditional 99.9% uptime SLAs toward “decision-ready data” agreements — ensuring that when an AI agent needs to act, all required data sources are not just available, but current, validated, and trustworthy.

The result will be a new set of care-abouts for organizations: not just “is it up?” but “is it right, is it fast, and can I trust it for critical operations?” In the agentic AI era, it’s not just about keeping the lights on; it’s about ensuring the right data gets to the right agent, at the right time, every time. And as AI agents become more integrated into business processes, these new metrics will come to define new levels of competitiveness and reliability.
