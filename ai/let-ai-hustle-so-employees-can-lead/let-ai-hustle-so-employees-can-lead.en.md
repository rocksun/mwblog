There’s undeniable tech momentum in business today. Frequent breakthroughs in large language models, automation, and generative artificial intelligence are enabling organizations to innovate at an unprecedented pace and fuel a new kind of experience economy. One that is always on, continuously learning and perpetually scaling. AI is [becoming a constantly available](https://thenewstack.io/frontier-ai-models-now-becoming-available-for-takeout/) ally, ready to support every customer in real-time with empathy and consistency. Now as agentic AI emerges, it’s expected to reshape the boundaries of customer experience, moving from reactive support to personalized, autonomous engagement.

Yet, despite this progress, many companies I speak with are unintentionally underserving their customers today. Not due to a lack of vision or intent, but because they’re constrained by limited capacity or high cost-to-serve. Simultaneously, rising consumer expectations and the explosion of communication channels are pushing businesses to work harder to deliver a seamless, 24/7 experience. Many teams simply don’t have the personnel or budget to keep up.

[According to Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5451663), “the growth of online purchasing and digital engagement is projected to drive a 16% increase in customer service interaction volume from 2024 to 2028, leading to the evolution of overall customer service programs”.

This is where AI, particularly intelligent virtual agents, can step in to help organizations address increasing demand and meet their [customers where they are by orchestrating channel-less experiences](https://thenewstack.io/authentication-actions-boost-security-and-customer-experience/) through phone, web, social media and more. AI is enabling organizations to finally match their ambition with execution.

Forward-thinking companies are using AI to automate increasingly complex tasks and augment the employee experience when it needs human intervention. This encourages employees to focus on high-value tasks that require creativity, critical thinking and emotional intelligence.

I’m watching it unfold firsthand. Our customers are deploying AI so they can manage their unmet and ever-increasing demand. As AI adoption accelerates, customer service teams aren’t necessarily shrinking. From what I am seeing, for now, they’re remaining stable as AI-driven virtual agents manage more conversations and copilots help agents handle complex or emotionally charged interactions.

AI is disrupting the workforce, and I believe it can continue to do so without reducing human value. We’re witnessing a transformation where AI can act as a force multiplier to extend human potential in ways that were previously impossible. In my view, businesses leading this shift are treating AI as a teammate, rather than a competitor.

According​​ to [a recent report from Genesys](https://www.genesys.com/resources/customer-experience-in-the-age-of-ai), two-thirds of CX leaders surveyed stated that greater AI adoption will increase their workforce’s engagement. As organizations realize AI’s vast potential to change the employee experience, they should be asking: How can AI be used strategically to evolve the role of our workforce? The answer lies in the unification of automation and augmentation.

Here are three key strategies to consider:

1. **AI and Automation: Redefining the Role of the Worker**

AI is quickly becoming the operational core of modern businesses. With intelligent automation, companies are transitioning from human-led execution to AI-led processes where people guide, refine, and enhance what technology handles. This is transforming our perception of work. Employees aren’t cogs in the machine. Instead, they’re the architects of how the machine runs.

Virtual agents are helping to reshape the customer experience by automating tasks that previously required the human touch. These advanced AI agents can handle more complex and ambiguous requests, gather information efficiently, and free employees to focus on strategic work and critical touchpoints.

Instead of reviewing every call manually, employees are relying on intelligent helpers, such as virtual supervisors and speech and text analytics, to scan every interaction, pinpoint high-impact engagements, and serve up concise summaries. That means less time spent digging through transcripts and more time improving outcomes.

Role-based AI — utilizing virtual agents and supervisors — enables support teams to meet customers where they are, delivering more personalized experiences and scaling rising workloads.

2. **Augmentation: Elevating Human Impact With AI**

While automation addresses service gaps, augmentation empowers employees to work smarter. Organizations should leverage AI to add layers of intelligence to human roles, resulting in faster decisions, improved performance, and a workforce that’s always one step ahead.

Supervisors, for example, no longer need to be overwhelmed by dashboards and evaluations. AI can deliver insights on team performance, flag burnout risks and suggest coaching tips based on real-time data.

But, supervisors aren’t the only ones benefiting. AI personalizes the employee experience across the board. Smart scheduling tools adapt to each individual preferences and workload, while training programs evolve based on how employees perform. Learning becomes dynamic and tailored, moving away from static, one-size-fits-all approaches.

In the customer experience, AI copilots are already assisting employees in managing high volumes of interactions. They identify customer intent and key pieces of customer information to suggest next best actions, generate answers from curated knowledge, prepopulate workflows and summarize customer conversations and wrap codes. These smart assistants can help streamline [operations and free employees to focus on high-impact tasks](https://thenewstack.io/automate-routine-tasks-with-an-ad-hoc-ansible-script/) that require human vision and judgment.

When it comes to knowledge, AI is [rendering the search bar obsolete](https://thenewstack.io/5-software-development-skills-ai-will-render-obsolete/). AI can deliver context-specific information precisely when employees need it, helping eliminate the need to hunt through extensive FAQs and articles.

AI shouldn’t be viewed as a tool to replace human creativity, empathy or instinct. It should be used to amplify these uniquely human skills and help people show up at their best.

3. **The New Workforce: Supervising AI to Evolve the Business**

The pertinent question isn’t if AI will reshape your workforce, but how. Organizations that adopt AI as a tool for employee empowerment, and design roles where humans train, supervise and refine AI systems, won’t just keep up; they’ll be better positioned to lead.

Supervisors will oversee both people and AI, setting expectations for output and maintaining accountability. They’ll play a crucial role in defining the tone, intent and responsible boundaries of AI behavior. This evolution demands a new layer of leadership that understands both emotional intelligence and data fluency.

As we explore the implications of [agentic AI](https://thenewstack.io/agentic-ai-for-enterprises-4-key-benefits-driving-innovation/) systems that have the potential to make decisions and operate with autonomy in the future, humans must remain in the loop and set the tone. Today, AI is capable of handling urgent but relatively simple customer requests. Soon, with the rise of agentic AI, it will take on conversations and problems that are more emotionally charged and complex. Tasks that were once thought to be solely in the human domain.

Human guidance will be required to ensure AI delivers value while aligning with company goals and customer expectations. The employee-AI partnership is expected to transform the workforce to be more scalable, adaptable and intrinsically human.

AI is not the end of human work. It’s the beginning of better work. The smartest move your organization can make right now is to partner with AI as your team’s most powerful ally.
