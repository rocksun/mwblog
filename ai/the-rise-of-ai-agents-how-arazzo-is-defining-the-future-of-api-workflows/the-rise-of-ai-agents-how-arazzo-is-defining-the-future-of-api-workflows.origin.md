Once, the rallying cry of the mobile revolution was, ‘There’s an app for that.’ Today, the new reality is that AI-powered agents are substantially changing how we interact with software, coining a new catchphrase: ‘There’s an agent for that!’ From automating tasks to executing complex workflows and acting autonomously on our behalf, AI agents are becoming critical intermediaries in digital interactions. While it may seem like magic, APIs—not new wizardry—still provide the connective fabric enabling these agentic workflows and serving this new class of consumers.

This shift has led to a massive acceleration in API consumption, with AI-driven API usage soaring throughout 2024 as the demand for machine-readable data exchanges skyrockets. The new wave of AI consumers has fuelled a drastic [800% increase](https://nordicapis.com/shift-to-ai-exploded-api-usage-in-2024/) in AI-related API production**, **further reinforcing the importance of designing structured, interoperable, and AI-ready APIs. As a result, thinking holistically about APIs — and [ensuring they are built for the AI era](https://thenewstack.io/why-api-first-matters-in-an-ai-driven-world/) — has never been more critical in all industry verticals.

The surge in API activity has also driven renewed momentum in standards-based initiatives like the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/) (OAI). In 2024, the initiative set a new bar for activity by releasing specifications like [Arazzo](https://www.openapis.org/arazzo) 1.0.0 and [Overlay](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2024/10/22/announcing-overlay-specification) 1.0.0, alongside two important patch versions of the OpenAPI Specification: [3.1.1 and 3.0.4](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2024/10/25/announcing-openapi-specification-patch-releases). This momentum has continued into 2025, marked by the recent patch release for [Arazzo 1.0.1](https://spec.openapis.org/arazzo/v1.0.1.html).

## Why Do Standards and Specifications Matter?
In today’s fast-evolving API landscape, where AI agents are emerging as first-class API consumers, standards and specifications play a critical role in ensuring interoperability, improving the tooling experience, and fostering a shared understanding of how APIs are designed, implemented, and consumed. Specifications such as OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and now Arazzo form the foundation for creating consistent, predictable API experiences — vital, especially as we enter the AI era.

This shift in API consumption has real implications. But why does this matter?

Extracting value from [APIs often requires more than a single](https://thenewstack.io/confluent-combines-cloud-native-and-on-premises-data-streaming-through-single-api/)** API call**. Instead, [workflows often demand a series of API](https://thenewstack.io/asyncapi-looks-to-unify-api-workflow-under-linux-foundation/) calls orchestrated programmatically to accomplish a specific task (or jobs). This same premise holds true when delegating responsibilities to an AI agent performing tasks autonomously on our behalf.

However, API documentation quality and accuracy vary significantly, creating challenges for all consumers. Even structured formats like OpenAPI descriptions do not [natively define complex workflows](https://thenewstack.io/boost-azures-faas-capabilities-with-durable-functions/), especially when spanning multiple APIs. Supporting documentation also often omits guidance on orchestrating multiple API calls into a cohesive workflow, especially in a manner that can be verified. Human consumers have compensated for these gaps through trial and error, out-of-band documentation, or direct communication with API providers. However, AI agents lack this flexibility, and we certainly do not want them engaging in trial-and-error executions without deterministic guidance to function reliably.

AI agents and systems to effectively and consistently leverage APIs require structured, deterministic, and reliable workflows — something only robust specifications can guarantee. By standardizing how a series of complex or sensitive API calls should be executed in concert, we can:

- Prevent AI hallucinations or incorrect outputs from AI-driven consumers.
- Ensure interoperability, quality, and efficiency across API ecosystems.
- Build trust between API producers and consumers, both human and machine.
By doing so, we simultaneously elevate the human developer experience (DX) and agent experience (AX).

As **David Roldán Martínez**, an **AI Researcher and Industry Advisor**, puts it:

“In the age of agentic AI, where autonomous systems increasingly rely on interacting with diverse APIs, a specification like Arazzo emerges as a critical enabler of deterministic and reliable API workflows. By providing a standardized framework for orchestrating complex API interactions, Arazzo empowers [developers to build robust and scalable](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-build-scalable-real-time-applications-with-javascript/) solutions. This enhances the predictability and efficiency of AI-driven systems and fosters greater trust and control, ensuring that the next wave of API consumption remains flexible and governable.”

## What Is the Arazzo Specification?
The Arazzo Specification (now at [version 1.0.1](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2025/01/24/announcing-arazzo-specification-version-1-0-1)) enables the crafting of deterministic API workflows—a structured series of API calls that, when combined, accomplish a specific business objective or consumer job to be done.

Arazzo supports JSON and YAML formats, allowing workflows to be human- and machine-readable. This makes API capabilities easier to understand and consume, accelerating adoption for traditional human developers and AI-agent consumers. By providing a structured way to express workflows, Arazzo bridges the gap between API producers and consumers, making it easier to integrate APIs efficiently.

Beyond readability, Arazzo’s assertiveness helps [API providers tackle key industry](https://thenewstack.io/a-look-at-telecom-apis/) challenges while enabling new possibilities for next-generation, agent-based API consumption. It also supports third-party verification, allowing regulatory bodies to [improve rigor and compliance](https://thenewstack.io/a-call-to-use-generative-ai-to-create-more-trustworthy-data/) across jurisdictions.

## Arazzo and AI-Agent API Consumption
Arazzo’s deterministic approach makes agentic API consumption more efficient. It allows API providers to deliver interoperable workflows across various LLMs and agent technology stacks. Providers can define and use case-oriented consumption semantics [across multiple API operations](https://thenewstack.io/linux-run-a-single-command-across-multiple-servers-with-ssh/), whether within a single API description or multiple independent API descriptions.

Additionally, Arazzo’s extensibility allows for the inclusion of usage-based or SLA-based metadata, which can be enforced at the processing or observability layer to ensure predictable scale, cost management, and intended AI-agent use of APIs which will be ever more important as IT leaders navigate the [total cost of ownership](https://thenewstack.io/how-real-time-database-design-boosts-total-cost-of-ownership/) (TCO) of new AI-fused topologies.

## APIs Are the *‘Best’ *Interfaces for Agents
The rise of AI agents for Computer Use (ACU) and Computer-Using Agents (UCAs) — including recent innovations like OpenAI’s Operator — demonstrates how AI can augment human workflows by interacting with existing user interfaces (UIs). This approach is instrumental in legacy environments, where AI can [unlock value quickly without requiring new API development](https://thenewstack.io/apis-are-driving-new-business-models-and-unlocking-revenue-streams/).

However, while leveraging UI-based automation may provide short-term gains, APIs are inherently the superior interface for AI agents. Unlike UIs, which are designed for human cognition, APIs are built for machine consumption, making them more scalable, reliable, and cost-effective in the long run.

Convenience technology has a habit of biting back, and while there can be short-term gains, executives may misinterpret those gains as cheaper, faster, and more consistent ways to enable AI goals. Just as [Robotic Process Automation](https://thenewstack.io/robocorp-makes-remote-process-automation-programmable/) (RPA) was often misinterpreted as a “quick automation solution” (only to lead to expensive maintenance costs later), short-term UI-based AI integrations risk becoming a crutch if companies fail to invest in API-first strategies.

By investing in robust API assets, organizations prepare for the inevitable shift where APIs, not UIs, become the primary interface for AI agents. This is where Arazzo comes in — by providing a deterministic API workflow layer, Arazzo ensures that agents interact with APIs in a structured, reliable way, rather than relying on fragile UI-based automation and delivering the agent experience (AX) needs mentioned earlier.

## Beyond AI: The Broader Use-Cases for Arazzo
While Arazzo is a key enabler of AI-based API consumption, it also provides broader value across the API lifecycle for API producers and consumers today:

- Provide deterministic API consumption recipes: Standardize workflows to ensure repeatable, structured API interactions.
- Act as living workflow documentation: Keep API workflows current without relying on outdated or external documentation.
- Automate consumer-facing documentation: Reduce reliance on out-of-band documentation by generating developer portal docs dynamically.
- Enable end-to-end test automation: Define API workflows that can be used for automated testing.
- Streamline regulatory compliance validation:
[Automate checks to verify API interactions against compliance](https://thenewstack.io/want-to-mitigate-risk-invest-in-automation/)requirements. - Empower next-generation API SDK generation: Enable workflow-aware SDKs for
[improved developer experiences](https://thenewstack.io/improve-developer-experience-to-prevent-burnout/).
The Arazzo Specification does not mandate a specific development process, such as *design-first* or *code-first*. It facilitates either technique by establishing precise workflow interactions with HTTP APIs described using the OpenAPI Specification (which it plans to [expand to event-based](https://github.com/OAI/Arazzo-Specification/issues/270) protocols and the AsyncAPI specification in the future).

## Arazzo — A Concrete Example
Let’s imagine we want to describe how to achieve a “Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL)” checkout workflow for online products. An agent will be responsible for determining if the products and customers are eligible for this type of financial engagement. The steps to perform the BNPL flow are:

- Check that selected products are BNPL-eligible
- Retrieve T&Cs and determine customer eligibility
- Create customer record (if needed)
- Initiate the BNPL Loan Transaction
- Authenticate customer and obtain loan authorization
- Calculate and retrieve payment play for client-side rendering
- Update order status
There are two APIs that offer the endpoints/methods needed to complete the process. They are:

Figure 2 – Buy Now, Pay Later – Loan API

Leveraging Arazzo, we can describe the workflow explicitly, giving the agent instructions to execute the workflow first and every time correctly.
