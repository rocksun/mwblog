The future of AI — who shapes it, and who ultimately benefits from it — is at a pivotal moment, as the industry grapples with challenges that demand our immediate attention.
The AI industry, currently witnessing a generative AI boom, is in a race for computational power. This surge in demand has led to GPU scarcity and skyrocketing costs for electricity, propelling the
[costs of innovation](https://thenewstack.io/7-ways-to-reduce-cloud-data-costs-while-continuing-to-innovate/) to unprecedented levels. This is problematic for the future of the industry. It creates a “winner takes all” market dominated by well-resourced big tech companies.
If you are a developer, researcher or an early-stage startup with a great idea, you will struggle to gain access to the tools, people and resources needed to be part of and help
[shape the future](https://thenewstack.io/how-5g-and-public-clouds-will-shape-the-future-of-applications/) of the industry, simply by virtue of being priced out of the market. This is bad innovation, which is bad for the future competitiveness for the U.S. and AI as an industry, and, ultimately, humanity.
Lowering barriers of entry, addressing copyright challenges and democratizing AI infrastructure are essential steps to guarantee that AI becomes a tide lifting all boats.
The importance of accessibility at the developer level cannot be overstated. It’s the key to unlocking doors to widespread
[innovation and ensuring checks and balances on AI development](https://thenewstack.io/three-factors-limiting-developers-innovation/).
A more inclusive approach brings together diverse voices and perspectives, preventing the future of AI from being shaped solely by a handful of CEOs. In this context, the “wisdom of crowds” can be a potent force in determining AI’s direction, ensuring a more balanced and representative vision for shaping our future.
There are also legal hurdles in the way of innovation that also favor the deep-pocketed few. The current copyright landscape in generative AI favors those armed with teams of lawyers. This disparity is further magnified by global AI legislation, like the EU AI Act, which often places smaller entities at a major disadvantage by holding developers responsible without considering their resource constraints.
**We Need a Developer-First Framework **
To break free from this dynamic, democratizing AI infrastructure is crucial. There should be voluntary transparency in AI research, clear disclosure on AI systems that collect and use our data, and protection for AI developers and open source.
Developers must have broad
[access to tools that allow](https://thenewstack.io/10-things-to-consider-when-allowing-access-to-production/) them to pursue their AI ideas independently. This not only fosters a more competitive and innovative landscape but also ensures that the benefits of AI are distributed widely.
Lowering barriers of entry, addressing copyright challenges and democratizing AI infrastructure are essential steps to guarantee that AI becomes a tide lifting all boats. The time for change is now, ensuring that the future of AI is shaped inclusively for the benefit of all.
