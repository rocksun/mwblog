The Greek Goddess Cassandra was known for foretelling the future, and now IBM is planning that its namesake open source database system and its associated tools will help its enterprise customers do the same — with AI.

On Tuesday, [IBM ](https://www.ibm.com?utm_content=inline+mention) announced [plans](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-02-25-ibm-to-acquire-datastax,-deepening-watsonx-capabilities-and-addressing-generative-ai-data-needs-for-the-enterprise) to acquire NoSQL database provider [DataStax](https://www.datastax.com/?utm_content=inline+mention). Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

IBM will fold DataStax technology, including the company’s flagship Cassandra open source NoSQL database system and its popular Langflow low code AI tool, into its own watsonx portfolio of generative AI products.

Founded in 2010, DataStax was built on Cassandra, though also created [AstraDB](https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra) cloud database service, Langflow, and [DataStax Enterprise](https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise), a commercial version of Cassandra. The company is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.

## Biggest Challenge for Generative AI
The biggest challenge businesses face today when spinning up their own generative AI applications is, in part, difficulties in managing data. IBM asserts that Cassandra’s vector capabilities and Langflow’s low-code development environment should both help in these regards.

Many of Cassandra’s current users — including companies in the software, retail, finance, and ecommerce sectors — are starting to use the database for [AI duties as well](https://thenewstack.io/apache-cassandra-poll-ai-use-cases-are-set-to-triple/).

DataStax’s hundreds of enterprise customers include FedEx, Capital One, The Home Depot and Verizon.

“As enterprises adopt AI, they often struggle to leverage and deliver the knowledge locked in their enterprise data estate to power their AI agents and large language models,” wrote DataStax Chairman and CEO [Chet Kapoor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chetkapoor/) in [a blog post](https://www.datastax.com/blog/ibm-plans-to-acquire-datastax) about the acquisition. “We have long said that there is no AI without data, and this vision will now be propelled as DataStax joins IBM.”

Datastax is not the only recent AI-related acquisition: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/?utm_content=inline+mention) also [purchased](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mongodb-acquires-voyage-ai-terms-140701161.html) VoyageAI. For [Subbu Iyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iyersubbu/), CEO of fellow database systems provider [Aerospike](https://aerospike.com/about-us/), these acquisitions point to how “the AI gold rush for data continues at a fevered pace.”

“For AI to realize its potential, organizations need massive amounts of real-time data to provide timely, accurate and meaningful results,” Iver wrote by e-mail.

## DataStax’s AI Chops
Cassandra has built-in [vector processing](https://thenewstack.io/vector-search-is-coming-to-apache-cassandra/) and [RAG capabilities](https://thenewstack.io/solving-the-rag-vs-long-context-model-dilemma/), both essential for [LLM-based](https://thenewstack.io/vector-processing-understand-this-new-revolution-in-search/) generative [AI applications](https://thenewstack.io/save-valuable-genai-tokens-with-this-one-simple-trick/). [Cassandra](https://thenewstack.io/apache-cassandra-the-data-foundation-for-real-time-ai/) is open source under an [Apache license](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html), and has over [9,000 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/cassandra).

The Python-based[ Langflow](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow), with a vendor-agnostic API, can be used to build RAG and multi-agent AI applications. It will add flexible middleware capabilities to the IBM watsonx.ai, an end-to-end AI development studio, according to IBM.

While Cassandra was DataStax’s flagship offering, Langflow has proven to be quite a success too, attracting thousands of users and earning over 49,000 stars on GitHub.

“Paired with Astra DB — the near-zero latency database with powerful vector and knowledge graph capabilities — and IBM’s watsonx.data, LangFlow provides one of the fastest routes to building enterprise-ready generative AI applications,” wrote [Ritika Gunnar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritika-gunnar/)
IBM general manager for data and AI in a blog post announcing the acquisition.

The [watsonx AI](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai?) platform already harnesses other open source technologies as [Iceberg](https://thenewstack.io/has-your-data-lakehouse-frozen-over-thaw-iceberg/), [Spark](https://thenewstack.io/is-apache-spark-too-costly-an-aws-engineer-tells-his-story/), Velox and [Presto](https://thenewstack.io/presto-for-big-data-sql-challenges-considerations-cloud-solutions/), and Meta’s [Velox](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/03/09/open-source/velox-open-source-execution-engine/) data execution engine.

IBM has made good use of open source-based companies in the past decade. In 2019, it [acquired](https://thenewstack.io/turning-blue-ibm-to-acquire-red-hat/) [Red Hat](https://www.openshift.com/try?utm_content=inline+mention), which offers a [Linux](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-linux-operating-system/) and [Kubernetes](https://www.thenewstack.io/Kubernetes)-based open source platform for the enterprise. And last year, IBM [set off](https://thenewstack.io/ibm-purchases-hashicorp-for-multicloud-it-automation/) to acquire [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) and its stack of cloud native automation tools. That deal is expected to close shortly.

DataStax also heavily participated in the[ Apache Pulsar](https://thenewstack.io/13-reasons-why-enterprises-should-use-apache-pulsar/) and [OpenSearch](https://thenewstack.io/opensearch-how-the-project-went-from-fork-to-foundation/) open source communities, which IBM plans to continue supporting.

The DataStax acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025, subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
