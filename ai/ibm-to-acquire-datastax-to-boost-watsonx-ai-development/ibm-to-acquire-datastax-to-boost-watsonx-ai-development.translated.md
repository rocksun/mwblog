In Greek mythology, Cassandra was famous for predicting the future. Now, IBM plans to use the namesake open-source database system and its associated tools to help its enterprise clients do the same with AI.

On Tuesday, [IBM](https://www.ibm.com?utm_content=inline+mention) announced plans to [acquire](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-02-25-ibm-to-acquire-datastax,-deepening-watsonx-capabilities-and-addressing-generative-ai-data-needs-for-the-enterprise) NoSQL database provider [DataStax](https://www.datastax.com/?utm_content=inline+mention).  Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

IBM will integrate DataStax technology—including the company's flagship Cassandra open-source NoSQL database system and its popular Langflow low-code AI tool—into its own watsonx generative AI portfolio.

Founded in 2010, DataStax built on Cassandra but also created the [AstraDB](https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra) cloud database service, Langflow, and [DataStax Enterprise](https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise) (a commercial version of Cassandra). The company is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.

## The Biggest Challenge for Generative AI

One of the biggest challenges facing enterprises today as they launch their own generative AI applications lies in the difficulties of data management. IBM asserts that Cassandra's vector capabilities and Langflow's low-code development environment should help in this area.

Many existing users of Cassandra—including companies in software, retail, finance, and e-commerce—are also beginning to use the database for [AI tasks](https://thenewstack.io/apache-cassandra-poll-ai-use-cases-are-set-to-triple/).

DataStax's hundreds of enterprise clients include FedEx, Capital One, Home Depot, and Verizon.

"As enterprises embrace AI, they often struggle to leverage and deliver the knowledge locked within their enterprise data assets to support their AI agents and large language models," DataStax Chairman and CEO [Chet Kapoor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chetkapoor/) wrote in a [blog post](https://www.datastax.com/blog/ibm-plans-to-acquire-datastax) about the acquisition. "We've long believed that there is no AI without data, and with DataStax joining IBM, this vision will be propelled forward."

DataStax isn't the only recent AI-related acquisition: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/?utm_content=inline+mention) also [acquired](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mongodb-acquires-voyage-ai-terms-140701161.html) VoyageAI. For [Subbu Iyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iyersubbu/), CEO of fellow database system provider [Aerospike](https://aerospike.com/about-us/), these acquisitions show that "the AI gold rush for data continues at a feverish pace."

Iyer wrote via email: "To unlock the potential of AI, organizations need massive amounts of real-time data to deliver timely, accurate, and meaningful results."

## DataStax's AI Technology

Cassandra has built-in [vector processing](https://thenewstack.io/vector-search-is-coming-to-apache-cassandra/) and [RAG capabilities](https://thenewstack.io/solving-the-rag-vs-long-context-model-dilemma/), both crucial for generative [AI applications](https://thenewstack.io/save-valuable-genai-tokens-with-this-one-simple-trick/) based on [large language models](https://thenewstack.io/vector-processing-understand-this-new-revolution-in-search/). [Cassandra](https://thenewstack.io/apache-cassandra-the-data-foundation-for-real-time-ai/) is open-source under the [Apache License](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html) and boasts over [9,000 stars](https://github.com/apache/cassandra) on GitHub.

The Python-based [Langflow](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow) has a vendor-agnostic API that can be used to build RAG and multi-agent AI applications. According to IBM, it will add flexible middleware capabilities to IBM watsonx.ai, an end-to-end AI development studio.

While Cassandra is DataStax's flagship product, Langflow has also seen considerable success, attracting thousands of users and garnering over 49,000 stars on GitHub.

"Used in conjunction with Astra DB, a near-zero latency database with powerful vector and knowledge graph capabilities, and IBM's watsonx.data, LangFlow provides one of the fastest paths to building enterprise-grade generative AI applications," wrote [Ritika Gunnar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritika-gunnar/), IBM's GM of Data and AI, in a blog post announcing the acquisition.
[watsonx AI](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai?) platform leverages other open-source technologies, such as [Iceberg](https://thenewstack.io/has-your-data-lakehouse-frozen-over-thaw-iceberg/), [Spark](https://thenewstack.io/is-apache-spark-too-costly-an-aws-engineer-tells-his-story/), Velox, and [Presto](https://thenewstack.io/presto-for-big-data-sql-challenges-considerations-cloud-solutions/), and Meta's [Velox](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/03/09/open-source/velox-open-source-execution-engine/) data execution engine.

IBM has a strong history of leveraging open-source-based companies over the past decade. In 2019, it [acquired](https://thenewstack.io/turning-blue-ibm-to-acquire-red-hat/)[Red Hat](https://www.openshift.com/try?utm_content=inline+mention), which provides enterprise-grade open-source platforms based on [Linux](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-linux-operating-system/) and [Kubernetes](https://www.thenewstack.io/Kubernetes). Last year, IBM [initiated](https://thenewstack.io/ibm-purchases-hashicorp-for-multicloud-it-automation/) the acquisition of [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) and its cloud-native automation tool stack.  This deal is expected to close soon.

DataStax is also heavily involved in the [Apache Pulsar](https://thenewstack.io/13-reasons-why-enterprises-should-use-apache-pulsar/) and [OpenSearch](https://thenewstack.io/opensearch-how-the-project-went-from-fork-to-foundation/) open-source communities, and IBM plans to continue supporting these communities.

The DataStax acquisition is expected to close in Q2 2025, subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
