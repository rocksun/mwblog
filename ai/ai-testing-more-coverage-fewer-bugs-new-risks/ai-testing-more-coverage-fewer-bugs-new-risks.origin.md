# AI Testing: More Coverage, Fewer Bugs, New Risks
The advent of generative AI is swiftly ushering in a new era in software testing. With AI test recorders designed to perform equivalent work to a human test automation engineer, GenAI has become so sophisticated that it interprets plain-language instructions to generate test automation code autonomously.

This capability democratizes testing, allowing individuals without coding expertise to interact with testing frameworks directly. It simplifies the entire test automation process by enabling users to effortlessly generate code by recording their interactions with websites — no manual coding required. GenAI-driven testers seamlessly integrate into CI/CD pipelines, autonomously detecting bugs and alerting teams about potential issues.

## Transforming QA With AI
From experience, the journey from human [automation tester to AI test](https://thenewstack.io/how-an-imbalanced-test-automation-strategy-hurts-business-agility/) automation engineer is a transformative process. Traditionally, transitioning to test automation required significant time and resources, including learning to code and understanding automation frameworks.

AI removes these barriers and speeds up development cycles, dramatically reducing time-to-market and improving accuracy, all while decreasing the level of admin tasks for software testers.

Through AI software testing, companies can rapidly decrease time to market. They can interpret test scenarios written in plain language, automatically [generate the necessary code](https://thenewstack.io/ai-code-generation-6-faqs-for-developers/) for test automation, and execute tests across various platforms and languages. This dramatically reduces the enablement time, allowing QA professionals to focus on strategic tasks instead of coding complexities. This, in turn, addresses the severe shortage in test automation, helping companies achieve often higher quality across digital offerings in no time, for any number of scenarios in parallel in a matter of minutes, creating test automation for multilingual websites and apps as well as for any screen size, including computers, tablets, and mobiles.

The productivity gains from AI in testing are substantial. We now have a vast international bank that we have helped leverage our solution to such an extent it managed to increase test automation coverage across two of its websites (supporting around ten different languages), taking it from a mere forty percent to almost ninety percent in a matter of weeks. I believe this is an amazing achievement, not only because of the end results but also because working in an enterprise environment with its security and integrations can typically take forever.

While traditional test automation might be limited to a single platform or language and the capacity of one person, AI-enhanced testing breaks these limitations. Testers can now create and execute tests on any platform (web, mobile, desktop), in multiple languages, and with the capacity of numerous testers. This amplifies testing capabilities and introduces a new level of flexibility and efficiency.

## The AI Advantage: Multilingual and 24/7 Testing
Upskilling QA teams with AI brings the significant advantage of multilingual testing and 24/7 operation. In today’s global market, software products must often cater to diverse users, requiring testing in multiple languages. AI makes this possible without requiring testers to know each language, expanding the reach and usability of software products.

The ability to test around the clock ensures that testing doesn’t become a bottleneck in fast-paced development. AI’s autonomous maintenance capabilities further reduce the time and effort needed to update test cases, ensuring tests remain relevant and practical. A recent report by IDC predicts that by 2028, GenAI-based tools will be able to write 70% of software tests. This will decrease the need for manual testing and improve test coverage, software usability, and code quality.

## Navigating the Challenges
The IDC predicts that by “2026, 45% of DevOps teams will use DevSecOps tools leveraging AI to identify [security challenges in applications](https://thenewstack.io/application-delivery-controllers-a-key-to-app-modernization/) and supply chains.” So, while GenAI offers significant advantages, it also presents operational and security challenges that organizations must address:

Some of these include hallucinations — AI may generate inaccurate or fabricated outputs during testing, leading to incorrect results and potentially overlooking critical issues. Data Privacy — the risk of sensitive data used during testing being mishandled or leaked raises significant privacy concerns. Another challenge is the lack of transparency. The “black box” nature of many AI systems makes it challenging to trace decision-making processes, hindering debugging and trust in the system.

Finally, security vulnerabilities mean systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks that could exploit system weaknesses, potentially compromising the testing process. Another challenge worth mentioning is inconsistent outputs — AI might produce erratic or irrelevant results, affecting test reliability and making it challenging to maintain consistent testing standards.

## Strategies for Risk Mitigation
To harness GenAI’s power while mitigating these risks, organizations can implement several strategies, such as Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Supervision or human oversight. This ensures that AI-generated outputs are rigorously validated for accuracy and reliability. Human supervisors can review and approve AI-generated test cases, ensuring they meet necessary standards before implementation. Another way is restricting AI autonomy, which helps limit the AI’s creative freedom and prevents the system from making unwarranted assumptions or actions.

Setting clear boundaries and guidelines for the AI ensures it operates within acceptable parameters, maintaining a predictable and reliable testing process. A third option requires reasoning for actions to enforce a policy where AI must explain its decisions, promote transparency, and build trust in AI-generated results. By demanding reasoning for each action, developers can gain valuable insights into the AI’s thought process and make informed adjustments. Lastly, [secure data management](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-api-sprawl-and-why-is-it-important/) practices help implement robust policies that safeguard sensitive information from being misused during AI training. Encryption, anonymization, and access controls are critical to protect data privacy.

## Use GenAI-Driven Testing Practices
Understanding its capabilities and limitations is paramount as GenAI becomes increasingly integrated into software development life cycles. By effectively managing these dynamics, development teams can leverage GenAI’s potential to enhance their [testing practices while ensuring the integrity of their software products](https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-revolutionizes-software-testing-and-accelerates-product-releases/). With careful consideration of the outlined challenges and mitigation strategies, organizations can harness the full power of GenAI to drive innovation in software testing and deliver high-quality software products.
