The pressure to ship features quickly can be overwhelming. Engineering teams can often prioritize speed over everything else, leading to compromises in code quality and architectural design.

In an effort to ship software as fast as possible, developers often build their own tools or deploy directly to the cloud, leading to the proliferation of shadow IT. This can lead to a proliferation of hundreds of little bespoke platforms running different sets of applications, each with its own set of configurations and dependencies.

This accumulation of [technical debt](https://thenewstack.io/how-frontend-devs-can-take-technical-debt-out-of-code/) increases maintenance costs and reduces development velocity. The hidden costs of unsustainable software are significant: complete rewrites, extended downtime, security breaches, compliance issues and frustrated development teams.

It’s important to clarify that prioritizing [sustainable software development](https://thenewstack.io/ebooks/cloud-infrastructure/developers-guide-to-cloud-infrastructure-efficiency-and-sustainability/) is not about slowing down innovation. Rather, it’s about making informed decisions early on to avoid much larger roadblocks and slowdowns later.

## Principles of Sustainable Software Development
Several key principles underpin sustainable software development:

**Modularity and maintainability:**Designing systems as a collection of independent, well-defined modules makes it easier to understand, modify and extend the codebase. This reduces the risk of introducing bugs and simplifies maintenance.**Backward compatibility:**Striving for backward compatibility ensures that existing users can continue to use the software without disruption when new features are added. This fosters user trust and avoids fragmentation, reducing the need for bespoke platforms.Implementing robust monitoring and logging systems provides insights into the behavior of the software in production. This allows developers to identify and address issues proactively, ensuring the long-term health and stability of the system. Observability and monitoring can also help prevent shadow IT by ensuring that all systems are[Observability and monitoring](https://thenewstack.io/monitoring-vs-observability-whats-the-difference/):[managed and secured](https://thenewstack.io/what-can-incident-teams-learn-from-crisis-management/)according to best practices.**Scalability and reusability:**Building scalable architectures that are also resource-efficient is crucial for long-term sustainability. By adhering to principles like strict separation of build and run stages, stateless processes and scaling out via the process model, companies can efficiently manage resources and scale applications as needed. This focus on[cloud native technologies](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native/)like containers and Kubernetes ensures sustainability in runtime and development platform innovation and standardization, allowing companies to use the latest advancements while maintaining consistency and efficiency in their development and deployment processes.
By adhering to these principles, development teams can avoid the pitfalls of short-term innovation and build robust, scalable and maintainable applications.

## How Twelve-Factor Principles Support Sustainability
[The Twelve-Factor App methodology](https://12factor.net/), while focused on cloud native applications, provides a solid foundation for sustainable software development. Several of its principles directly align with sustainability goals:
**Codebase:**Maintaining a single codebase tracked in version control promotes consistency and collaboration.**Dependencies:**Explicitly declaring and isolating dependencies minimizes conflicts and simplifies maintenance.**Config:**Storing configuration outside of the code ensures that the application can be deployed and configured consistently across different environments.**Logs:**Treating logs as a stream of events enables centralized logging and analysis, facilitating observability and monitoring.
For platforms, the [Twelve-Factor principles](https://thenewstack.io/heroku-moved-twelve-factor-apps-to-open-source-whats-next/) provide a blueprint for building scalable, maintainable and portable applications. By adhering to these principles, platforms can ensure that applications deployed on them are well-structured, easy to manage and can be scaled up or down as needed. The principles promote a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to update and maintain the platform and the applications running on it. This translates to increased agility, reduced risk and improved overall sustainability of the platform and the software ecosystem it [supports.](https://thenewstack.io/open-source-drives-the-twelve-factor-modernization-project/)

Adapting Twelve-Factor for modern architectures requires careful consideration of containerization, orchestration and serverless technologies. However, the core principles of clarity, modularity and maintainability remain highly relevant.

## Best Practices for Balancing Innovation With Longevity
Achieving the balance between innovation and longevity requires a combination of technical practices and cultural shifts:

**Adopting a platform mindset:**Define your value line in DIY versus standardized and shared services/reuse of components and APIs. Carefully consider which areas of your software development process are unique differentiators that require custom solutions and which can benefit from standardized platforms and shared services.**Automated testing and CI/CD:**Comprehensive automated testing and CI/CD pipelines ensure code quality and allow for rapid iteration without sacrificing stability.**Progressive refactoring:**Instead of undertaking massive rewrites, adopt a strategy of progressive refactoring. Continuously improve the codebase in small, manageable increments,[addressing technical debt](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-persuade-your-organization-to-pay-down-technical-debt/)and improving maintainability over time.**Developer culture:**Foster a culture that values thoughtful decision-making over quick fixes without hindering creativity and productivity. Encourage developers to consider the long-term implications of their code and prioritize maintainability alongside feature delivery.**Open standards and interoperability:**Adhering to open standards and designing for interoperability reduces vendor lock-in and ensures that the software can adapt to future changes in technology.
## Bottom Line
Sustainable software development is not just a technical discipline; it’s a mindset. It requires a commitment to building systems that are not only functional but also maintainable, scalable and adaptable. By embracing these principles and practices, developers and organizations can create software that delivers value over the long term, balancing the need for innovation with the imperative of longevity.

Focus on building a culture that values quality and maintainability, and invest in the tools and processes that support sustainable software development. Work in the platform for scale and sustainability. The long-term benefits — reduced costs, increased agility and improved user satisfaction — will far outweigh the initial investment.
