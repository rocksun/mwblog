[Prompt engineering](https://thenewstack.io/prompt-engineering-get-llms-to-generate-the-content-you-want/) is a critical aspect of leveraging the [Gemini API](https://thenewstack.io/gemini-all-you-need-to-know-about-googles-multimodal-ai/) for generating tailored and effective outputs from the language model. This practice involves designing and refining prompts to guide the LLM toward generating the desired content, whether for creative writing, coding, data analysis or any other application where natural language generation can be applied. The success of prompt engineering hinges not just on the skillful crafting of the prompt itself, but also on understanding and optimizing the parameters provided by the Gemini API, such as
temperature,
max_output_tokens,
top_p and
top_k.
The importance of these parameters in prompt engineering cannot be overstated, as they enable users to customize the model’s behavior to specific needs, ensuring that the generated content meets the desired standards of accuracy, relevance, creativity and coherence.
This article aims to explore the nuances of the parameters of the Gemini API, providing insights into how these parameters can be leveraged to maximize the effectiveness of generated content across various applications.
## A Closer Look at the API Parameters
The Gemini API provides a suite of parameters to fine-tune the generation of text, allowing users to balance between creativity and accuracy effectively. Here’s an overview of the key parameters, along with their impacts on the creativity and accuracy of LLM responses.
The below code snippet provides the basic structure of the API call for both text generation and chat completion. Refer to the previous tutorial, “

from google.cloud import aiplatform
import vertexai
from vertexai.preview.generative_models import GenerativeModel, Part
vertexai.init()
model = GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")
response = model.generate_content(“What's the meaning of life?”,
max_output_tokens=128,
temperature=0,
top_p=1,
top_k=5
)
print(response.text)
**Max_output_tokens**: This parameter sets the maximum length of the model’s response in terms of tokens, which can be roughly equated to words. It controls the verbosity of the output, with a higher limit allowing for longer, more detailed responses. The choice of this limit can affect the depth and comprehensiveness of the response, but doesn’t directly influence its creativity or accuracy. **Temperature**: This parameter controls the randomness of the output. A higher temperature increases creativity by making less probable tokens more likely to be chosen, leading to more varied and unexpected outputs. Conversely, a lower temperature results in more predictable, conservative outputs. It’s a crucial parameter for controlling the balance between creativity and determinism in the model’s responses. **Top_p (nucleus sampling)**: This parameter, also known as nucleus sampling, controls the cumulated probability threshold for token selection, ensuring that only the most probable tokens (up to a specified cumulative probability) are considered. This allows for a dynamic balance between creativity and accuracy. A lower threshold (closer to 0) will make the model’s outputs more focused and less diverse, while a higher threshold increases the variety of tokens used, potentially making the output more creative but less predictable. **Top_k**: This parameter limits the selection of the next token to the k most likely tokens. A lower value of k restricts the model to a narrower choice of words, leading to more predictable outputs, while a higher value allows for a wider selection of tokens, increasing the potential creativity of the output. However, setting it too high can detract from the relevance and accuracy of the content.
In comparison,
temperature and
top_p are more directly related to controlling the model’s creativity, with higher values for either leading to more novel and varied outputs. The
top_k parameter offers a more granular control over the selection pool of next tokens, directly influencing the diversity and potential creativity of the output. The parameter
max_output_tokens, while not directly affecting creativity, sets the scope of the response, affecting the model’s ability to develop ideas fully or provide detailed information.
Each of these parameters plays a significant role in tailoring the LLM’s output to specific needs, allowing users to fine-tune the balance between creativity and accuracy based on the task at hand. Adjusting these parameters can significantly influence the model’s performance, making it imperative to understand their effects thoroughly for optimal results.
## Grounding and Function Calling Expand Gemini’s Ability
Gemini introduced advanced function calling capabilities, which allow developers to seamlessly integrate external tools and APIs into their AI-driven applications. This feature enables the model to interact with external data sources and services, thereby extending its utility and application scope far beyond what’s possible with standalone AI models. For example, by defining functions that the model can call based on the input it receives, developers can create more dynamic, responsive and useful AI applications. This could range from fetching real-time data from external APIs to processing and generating outputs based on complex external datasets.
The sophistication of Gemini’s function-calling mechanism is a testament to its design as a highly interactive and integrable AI model, ready to tackle a wide array of practical use cases. In the upcoming parts of this series, I will walk you through the steps of integrating real-time flight tracking API with Gemini through a function-calling technique.
Grounding is another technique that enhances Gemini’s ability to provide relevant and accurate information by incorporating context-specific data into its processing. This capability, often supported by semantic search and
[retrieval-augmented generation](https://thenewstack.io/freshen-up-llms-with-retrieval-augmented-generation/) models, enables the LLM to access and use external knowledge bases effectively, making it more adept at answering queries with high precision.
Grounding provides the following benefits:
**Reduced hallucinations**: Grounding minimizes the occurrence of model hallucinations by preventing the generation of non-factual content. **Anchored responses**: Grounding ensures that model responses are firmly anchored to specific information, enhancing their relevance and reliability. **Enhanced trustworthiness and applicability**: Grounded content is more trustworthy and practically applicable, leading to improved user satisfaction and confidence in the generated output.
Google has integrated
[Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-search-and-conversation) with Gemini to provide grounding capabilities to the LLM. Similar to function calling, the model can be pointed to the data store index within Search to retrieve context information.
The Gemini API, with its customizable parameters — such as
temperature,
max_output_tokens,
top_p, and
top_k — offers unparalleled flexibility in tailoring AI-generated content to specific needs, balancing creativity and accuracy effectively.
Additionally, Gemini’s grounding and function-calling capabilities significantly expand its utility, enabling it to integrate external data sources and services seamlessly into its responses. These features collectively enhance Gemini’s ability to deliver contextually relevant, accurate and highly interactive AI applications across a wide range of domains.
