[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), Anthropic’s coding agent, has quickly become a developer favorite, especially after the company launched its [Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4 models](https://thenewstack.io/claude-opus-4-with-claude-code-a-developer-walkthrough/). Yet while Claude Code is probably already contributing to many enterprise code bases, until now, enterprise admins didn’t really get any visibility into how those teams are using it. That’s changing today, with the launch of the [Claude Code enterprise analytics dashboard](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/analytics).

An analytics dashboard was among the company’s most requested features, according to an Anthropic spokesperson. Now, these admins will be able to see a variety of metrics, including lines of code accepted, suggestion accept rate, total user activity over time, total spend over time and the average daily spend for each user and the average daily lines of code accepted for each user.

For many enterprises, tracking spend may actually be the most important feature here. For consumers and individual developers, Claude Code is part of the company’s paid plans, starting at $17/month (with Claude Code limited to the mainstream Sonnet 4 model) and going up to $100/month and $200/month for the Max plans with access to to the Opus 4 models and higher usage limits.

For teams and enterprises, however, Anthropic bills by API usage — and using Claude Code can consume AI tokens at a rapid clip.

None of this has hurt adoption so far, though. Since [launching the Claude 4 models in May](https://thenewstack.io/anthropic-launches-claude-opus-4-and-sonnet-4/), Anthropic says, the active user base for Claude Code has grown 300%. Run-rate revenue has grown 5.5x — suggesting developers are not just adopting Claude Code but ramping up their usage.

[Over the last few weeks, Anthropic launched Model Context Protocol support for Claude Code](https://thenewstack.io/anthropics-claude-code-gets-support-for-remote-mcp-servers/) and just a few days ago, it also made Claude Code natively available for Windows (previously, developers had to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux to access the tool).
