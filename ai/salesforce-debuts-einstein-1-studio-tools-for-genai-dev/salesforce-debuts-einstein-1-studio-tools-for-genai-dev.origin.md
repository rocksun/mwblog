Developers responsible for
[Salesforce](https://salesforce.com) installations at 150,000 companies worldwide now have a shiny new set of tools designed specifically for GenAI-type applications.
At its
[TrailblazerDX](https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazerdx/) developer conference on March 6 and 7, the San Francisco-based company launched [Einstein 1 Studio](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2024/03/06/einstein-1-studio-news/), a set of [low-code](https://thenewstack.io/confessions-of-a-low-code-convert/) tools that enable admins and developers to customize Einstein Copilot — a conversational AI assistant for CRM — and embed [AI bots](https://thenewstack.io/developers-put-ai-bots-to-the-test-of-writing-code/) as needed in any app.
## User-Friendly Tools
The new package is designed to make AI development user-friendly without compromising data security,
[John Kucera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnkucera/), Salesforce SVP of Product Management, told analysts in a press preview. The tools now available are: **Copilot Builder**, for creating AI actions in Einstein Copilot to handle tasks for various workflows. Admins and developers can use tools they already have, such as Apex, Flow and [MuleSoft APIs](https://thenewstack.io/mulesoft-concession-openapi-adopts-raml-different-approach-api-documentation-descriptions/), along with [GenAI](https://thenewstack.io/generative-ai-in-2023-genai-tools-became-table-stakes/)components such as prompts, to enable Copilot to complete tasks. Copilot can use these custom actions to complete tasks across any Salesforce application or external system. **Prompt Builder**. This enables admins and developers to create custom, reusable [AI prompts](https://thenewstack.io/developer-tips-in-ai-prompt-engineering/)without coding. It not only broadens the use of GenAI beyond conversational interfaces but also allows users to design and repurpose prompts for use across other sessions. For example, a custom prompt can be embedded in a contact record as a button, enabling an agent in the contact center to get a snapshot of all escalated cases for a customer in one click. **Model Builder**for selecting the most appropriate large language models (LLMs) from Salesforce or its partners or building a customized predictive AI model based on the use case. **Trailhead AI courses**, instructions for using Einstein Copilot and Prompt Builder on the company’s [free online learning platform](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/).
“Unlike other solutions that limit businesses to a single LLM,” Kucera said, “Einstein 1 Studio provides the flexibility to connect to a variety of AI models. This is a no-code, low-code, and pro-code way for companies to build their own predictive AI models, trained on their (Salesforce) Data Cloud data.”
Businesses can use predictive and generative AI models and services from Salesforce partners that include AWS via
[Amazon Bedrock](https://thenewstack.io/10-key-products-for-building-llm-based-apps-on-aws/) and Amazon SageMaker, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Cohere, Databricks, Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, and OpenAI, and train or fine-tune select models on Data Cloud data without moving or copying data.
In a recent
[survey conducted by Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/ai-it-demand-gap/), 90% of IT professionals claimed that GenAI has forced them to re-evaluate their technology strategies. This change in mindset affects how new apps and services are onboarded and used within their organizations. Admins say they need more intuitive user interfaces to make it easy to interact with AI in the flow of work; more AI models to fit their use cases; and better access to trusted customer and business data to ground the AI models and ensure accurate and relevant results.
## Islands of Data
“It’s clear that companies have a lot of enterprise data, but that data still lives in silos,”
[Clara Shih](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarashih/), CEO of Salesforce AI, told analysts. “I’m talking about islands of trapped data across databases like AWS and [Google Cloud](https://thenewstack.io/google-cloud-services-hit-by-outage-in-paris/) applications. In fact, the average company has to navigate thousands of these data islands. Not only that, the format of the data in these different islands varies. Some of it is structured in a database and CRM. Some of it is unstructured, like emails, PDF, and conversation transcripts. These aren’t the unified data sets that AI models need to perform accurately and avoid hallucinations.”
Einstein 1 Studio is integrated directly with Salesforce Data Cloud, which finds and unifies trapped data and AI models with intelligence on customer data and metadata, Shih said. The Studio toolbox connects the user interface, a variety of AI models and data in a single metadata-driven platform, she said. This facilitates low-code and no-code customization of Einstein Copilot (not to be confused with Microsoft’s AI tool of the same name), as well as building and modifying embedded prompts and actions that connect to AI models in the flow of work.
Einstein 1 Studio also includes the company’s security feature,
[Einstein Trust Layer](https://www.salesforce.com/products/secure-ai/). New to this is customer-configured data masking, enabling admins to select the fields they want to mask, providing greater control. Additionally, the audit trail and feedback data collected from AI prompts and responses are now stored in Data Cloud, where it can be reported on or used for automated alerts through Flow and other Einstein 1 Platform tools.
Prompt Builder and Model Builder are now available globally. Copilot Builder is available in beta globally.
