There’s a seismic shift taking place in software development. [Anthropic’s CEO recently predicted](https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-ceo-ai-90-percent-code-3-to-6-months-2025-3) that within the next three to six months, AI could be writing 90% of the code currently managed by software developers. While this may seem like a harbinger of doom for developers, it’s more accurately a signal of transformation.

The shift toward AI-assisted coding isn’t about replacing developers; it’s about evolving their roles into overseers of quality, security and maintainability. Whether it’s “[vibe coding](https://thenewstack.io/vibe-coding-where-everyone-can-speak-computer-programming/)” with AI tools for rapid prototyping or using AI as a core component of code creation, one thing is clear: AI will elevate developer roles, not erase them.

## **Why Developer Jobs Aren’t Going Anywhere**

One of the biggest concerns about AI in software development is the potential for “code rot.” AI without human oversight can generate code that lacks structure, has hidden vulnerabilities and is difficult to maintain. [Ensuring code health](https://thenewstack.io/ai-generated-code-requires-a-trust-and-verify-approach/) and avoiding “code rot” requires skilled developers. The need for humans to guide, review and validate AI-generated code guarantees the continued demand for their expertise.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics supports this outlook, [projecting](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) a 25% job growth for software developers from 2022 to 2032. Recent trends also show product management and engineering positions on the rise. According to a recent survey from [Lenny’s Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/state-of-the-product-job-market-in), we’re seeing the highest number of open project manager (PM) and engineering roles in over 2.5 years, with over 6,000 open PM roles and more than 58,000 open engineering roles globally right now. This isn’t the sign of a dying profession, but one that’s adapting and expanding.

## **Vibe Coding vs. AI Coding**

The way we interact with code generation is bifurcating, and it’s useful to understand the emerging distinctions: “vibe coding” and “AI coding.”

Vibe coding is becoming to mean the use of AI tools to rapidly throw things together without verification as proofs of concept (POC) or non-business-critical applications. It’s about getting something working fast, where quality is not the primary focus. Vibe coding has incredible speed for prototyping and lowers the barrier to [software development](https://thenewstack.io/code-quality-becomes-even-more-vital-in-the-ai-era/), allowing for quick experimentation. However, it can lead to quickly increasing technical debt if not managed, with potential for overlooked security issues and a lack of integration with existing complex systems.

In contrast, AI coding involves AI playing a substantial role in writing the code, but within a structured development process. Here, the developer acts as an architect, reviewer and verifier. The AI assists, but the human validates, secures and ensures the code meets stringent quality standards. [AI coding helps accelerate the development of complex features](https://thenewstack.io/how-generative-ai-coding-assistants-increase-developer-velocity/), can support the identification of potential bugs or inefficiencies early with the right analysis solutions in place and can automate boilerplate code so developers can focus on higher-level design and logic.

No matter what, the developer’s intelligence and experience are crucial — either to manage the “vibe” and its downstream consequences or to meticulously guide and validate the AI’s output.

## **AI Won’t Replace Developers, but Will Uplevel Them**

We’re witnessing a significant shift due to AI: Software engineers are spending less time on line-by-line coding and now [have a bigger job ensuring the quality of the AI code](https://thenewstack.io/why-quality-code-matters-and-how-to-achieve-it/) — meticulous design, rigorous validation, long-term maintainability and robust security. As AI generates code much faster, developer teams now have a much larger verification job than before.

This pivot echoes the need for a “you break it, you own it” approach, where [developers take full responsibility for all the code they manage](https://thenewstack.io/arming-developers-with-the-power-of-clean-code/), whether they write it themselves or it’s generated by AI. It’s no longer just about writing the lines of code, but understanding the entire ecosystem that those lines create and having ownership over it.

AI coding tools certainly support efficiency (say 58% of respondents) and productivity (81%), per the [Stack Overflow annual survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/ai). However, AI is not perfect, so accountability and architectural oversight are paramount. Developers will need to become experts in code design, understanding the nuances of the AI-generated code and ensuring it aligns with architectural patterns and business requirements. This elevates their role from simply writing code to guiding and validating it.

## **Best Practices for AI-Driven Code Development**

There are several practices that developers should follow to ensure that AI is used effectively and responsibly. Priority No. 1 is accountability — “you break it, you own it.” Code, particularly AI code, must be scrutinized and developers must feel responsibility toward it. Other practices to follow include:

* **Comprehensive documentation,** not just of what the code does, but why it’s structured a certain way. This is critical not just for humans, but for AI.
* **Striving for clarity and simplicity,** and establishing clear processes to prevent disorder and prompt large language models (LLMs) with guardrails.
* **Ensuring there is no stray or unnecessary code,** a common issue with AI-generated output.
* **Analyzing everything** and enabling developers with tools that can reliably enforce consistent coding and architectural standards, plus help find hard-to-detect runtime and security issues that AI can miss.
* **Mandatory unit tests,** with the tests written in advance and not by the same coding agent that is writing the code.
* **Vigilant code reviews,** which require disciplined development teams and proper tooling to enable automated checks.

These measures help ensure that AI augments, rather than degrades, code quality and developer efficiency.

## **The Consequences of Bad Code**

Many companies operate with millions of lines of legacy code. AI coding must be implemented in this context, meaning AI tools need to work alongside and improve existing systems. If they don’t, the consequences of poor-quality software are significant.

This cost is not just an abstract concept; it’s a massive financial drain and reputational risk. In the United States alone, bad code can cost a staggering [$2.41 trillion](https://www.it-cisq.org/the-cost-of-poor-quality-software-in-the-us-a-2022-report/), with accumulated technical debt around $1.52 trillion. Fixing a bug in production can be up to 100 times more expensive than fixing it during the design phase.

Beyond monetary costs, software failures can cripple operations, damage brand trust and lead to significant security breaches. AI can amplify these issues if not used responsibly, leading to more complex and difficult-to-maintain codebases.

AI is a powerful tool, but it is not a replacement for developers. Instead, it is evolving their roles. The future of software development is not one without developers but one where developers are elevated and focused on oversight, quality and security.
