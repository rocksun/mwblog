Across the globe, companies are investing heavily in AI agents. [Research reveals](https://www.pagerduty.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Agentic-AI-Survey-Report_FINAL.pdf) that more than half of organizations in the United States, UK, Australia and Japan have already [deployed agents](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-a-comprehensive-introduction-for-developers/) and a further third will do so over the coming two years. When deployed and used correctly, they can improve operational efficiency, reduce costs and free up talent to focus on high-value tasks.

However, success is not guaranteed. Engineering and development teams will need to understand how AI is fundamentally reshaping the way they work. They must also do so without the luxury of months or years of strategic planning. With competitors already gaining an advantage, there’s no time to waste.

## **Expectations Are High**

[AI agents](https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-agents-will-change-the-web-for-users-and-developers/) represent the next generation of artificial intelligence. They’re capable of working autonomously on the problems set for them by humans. Agents are continuously learning and adapting, analyzing plans, executing tasks and making independent decisions based on relevant data. For developers, this could significantly streamline [CI/CD pipelines by automating manual work](https://thenewstack.io/harnessing-ai-to-elevate-automated-software-testing/), reviewing and improving code, and accelerating prototyping.

That’s part of the reason why so many enterprises are bullish about the technology. More than three-fifths (62%) expect more than [100% return on investment from agentic AI](https://www.pagerduty.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Agentic-AI-Survey-Report_FINAL.pdf), with the average expected return standing at 171%, rising to 192% in the United States.

Here are eight steps developers and engineers can take to successfully deploy AI agents.

## **1)** **Find the Right Place To Start**

The first AI project is arguably the most important. Demonstrate some quick wins, and it could build trust with stakeholders to rapidly scale AI use across the organization. The key here is to not be too ambitious. Look for well-understood workflows with plenty of manual, repetitive work. That means prioritizing tasks that are predictable and low risk, feature structured data and have desired outcomes that are well defined.

## **2)** **Get Into the Right Mindset**

AI agents can be a game changer for organizations, but only if their people are open to change. Employees can help drive adoption by providing regular feedback to managers, encouraging colleagues to be open-minded and taking time out to learn and experiment with the technology. They can encourage colleagues to share their successes and failures that help to identify what works, enabling them to avoid repeating the mistakes of others.

## **3)** **Understand Clearly How Agents Work With Humans**

AI agents might be autonomous, but systems can’t and shouldn’t function without a human in the loop. Understanding the limits of the technology on the one hand and where it can assist teams on the other is critical to optimizing its use. Assign a human owner to each AI agent workflow and clearly define when the agent should act, assist or escalate. Regular employee feedback loops can also help improve agent performance over time.

## **4)** **Measure ROI Effectively From the Start**

Measuring value is key to getting buy-in and budget from business leaders and identifying successful approaches to focus on for the future. Metrics such as time saved, reduced manual interventions and efficiency gains can help to track value from agentic AI projects over time. But be sure to speak the language of the business too, by sharing qualitative and quantitative insight. [Agents might have freed up team members](https://thenewstack.io/empowering-it-teams-through-seamless-ui-and-ai-agents/) to focus on non-menial tasks, for example.

## **5)** **Choose the Right Tech Partner**

AI agents are far from commoditized, making the choice of tech partner extremely important. Look for platforms that are built for critical operations, backed by deep domain expertise and have robust, enterprise-grade guardrails in place for governance and compliance. Any new tech should also be able to integrate with the existing stack, enabling staff to pick it up without major retraining or technology hurdles to jump.

## **6)** **Embrace Offers of Training and Support**

To get the most out of AI agents, engineers may need to shift their mindsets to one of collaborator and supervisor rather than end user. They should embrace any [opportunity they can get to learn more](https://thenewstack.io/3-strategies-to-turn-incidents-into-learning-opportunities/), whether it’s how to handle hallucinations and unexpected behavior or how to improve their prompt engineering skills. Employers will increasingly be on the lookout for developers and engineers with good AI literacy.

## **7)** **Be Accountable and Responsible**

Organizations must balance opportunity with risk, according to their enterprise risk appetite. Engineers should fulfill their duties as responsible users of the technology by eschewing shadow AI tools in favor of approved solutions, or lobby senior managers if they are moving too slowly. They should share acceptable AI use policies as widely as possible across the team to establish accountability and document learnings from early, low-risk deployments to help inform governance for more sensitive use cases.

## **8)** **Be Open to Sharing and Scaling Best Practice**

After the successful use of AI agents on a project, the outcomes should be shared with the broader organization to build momentum. Turn success factors like workflow type, training strategies or communication methods into repeatable playbooks and share them across adjacent teams. Engineers might even want to get involved in the creation of centralized knowledge bases, troubleshooting tips and onboarding guides to help others.

## **Time to Shine**

As bullish as many global organizations are about the adoption of AI agents, there are caveats. [Research](https://www.pagerduty.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Agentic-AI-Survey-Report_FINAL.pdf) indicates that two-fifths are concerned about rushing in too quickly, spending too much money on unproven technology and/or not having sufficient guidelines in place.

The key, as with all new technology investments, is to start small and build momentum with early wins. Adopting AI agents is not a silver bullet, and governance guardrails, including human oversight, will be needed to make a success out of deployments. Those who prioritize business outcomes throughout, rather than adopting the technology for its own sake, will be best placed to benefit.

It’s time to take the plunge.
