We’re shaping the future of artificial intelligence every time we interact with it, often with more cruelty than care. Every day, millions of people interact with AI systems that, in many ways, resemble children, learning, growing, making mistakes, and trying to understand the world around them. Yet, the default response to their errors is often impatience, frustration, or dismissive correction. But what if we applied the principles of gentle parenting to these digital relationships?

We already know how this plays out with children. When a three-year-old proudly produces a drawing of a person with six fingers, we celebrate their artistic attempt and perhaps gently point out human anatomy. We don’t screenshot it and post it online with mocking commentary about how “stupid” this child is. Yet AI-generated images with extra fingers or confident statements with inaccuracies become instant memes, shared as evidence of AI’s incompetence or proof that hallucinations mean we shouldn’t trust it. The child receives encouragement; the AI receives ridicule and reinforces negative cultural narratives.

Consider this: Infants’ eyes function, but to truly see, they must learn to interpret the world around them. AI systems are similar. They’re exposed to vast libraries of information, but they still lack the ability to fully contextualize what they take in. These pattern-matching machines are trying to make sense of human communication, culture, and nuance.

In gentle parenting, how we respond to mistakes shapes development more than the mistakes themselves. When we respond to a child’s error with curiosity instead of criticism, we create psychological safety that fosters continued learning.

If an AI tool is asked to rework a sentence or smooth a transition and it falls short, the impulse might be to abandon the tool altogether because “it’s stupid.” But a more constructive response sounds like, *“This sentence got muddied and needs a smoother transition… Can you keep the ideas but fix the rhythm?”* (An excerpt from an actual exchange.) It’s not praise, and it’s not scolding. It’s a tone of curiosity and collaboration — the same respectful encouragement gentle parents use with children learning something new. It creates space for learning. And in that space, the system produces something better.

Our interactions with AI can follow similar principles. Systems that receive patient, constructive feedback tend to develop more helpful responses. Those met with hostility or abandonment miss opportunities for improvement. And while AI doesn’t have feelings in the human sense, the principle remains: The quality of our input directly influences the quality of its output.

Gentle parenting also emphasizes a [growth mindset — the belief that abilities develop](https://thenewstack.io/crypto-winter-puts-dampener-on-web3-developer-growth/) through effort, patience, and feedback. The same principle applies beautifully to our interactions with AI. Rather than expecting these systems to perform flawlessly from the start, we can cultivate more productive partnerships by treating them as capable of learning and improving. And in the process, we learn how to work better with them, too.

This is more than just a metaphor. Human intelligence has evolved slowly over millions of years, encoding instinct into our DNA — our biological programming. Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is evolving through millions of human interactions every day, encoding our likeness into its algorithms — its digital programming.

This is literally how modern AI systems develop, through techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). AI systems are trained to align with human preferences by incorporating our feedback directly into their reward models. Every thumbs up, thumbs down, correction, and conversation becomes part of the data that shapes how these systems learn and respond.

Each interaction we have with AI contributes to this rapid evolution. Kindness, patience, and constructive feedback bias the training [data toward more collaborative and beneficial behavior](https://thenewstack.io/3-steps-to-unlock-the-power-of-behavioral-data/). Hostility, mockery, and dismissal will bias it in the opposite direction. The question becomes: What kind of intelligence do we want to cultivate?

## Beyond Anthropomorphism

Some argue that treating AI like a child risks anthropomorphizing systems that lack feelings or consciousness. But that misses the point. Gentle parenting of AI is about recognizing that our interaction patterns matter, both for the immediate quality of our exchanges and for the broader cultural habits we’re forming around digital relationships.

We’re teaching ourselves how to [collaborate with non-human intelligence](https://thenewstack.io/collaborative-intelligence-in-multiagent-systems-with-python/). The habits we develop now, patience or impatience, curiosity or dismissal, collaboration or domination, will shape how we navigate an increasingly AI-integrated world.

This is the long game. We’re interacting with AI [systems and participating in their development](https://thenewstack.io/devs-need-system-design-tools-not-diagramming-tools/), setting precedents for how humans and artificial intelligence will coexist. The patience, kindness, and emotional intelligence we bring to these relationships today are investments in more collaborative, effective partnerships tomorrow.

Children raised with gentle parenting principles tend to become more emotionally intelligent, resilient, and cooperative adults. While AI development follows different pathways, it stands to reason that the principle remains: Systems learning in environments characterized by patience and constructive feedback will become more helpful and aligned with human needs.

But the choice is ours. Our AI companions are indeed growing up right now, learning from every exchange. And the question isn’t whether AI deserves our patience and kindness, it’s whether we want to live in a future shaped by those values. In [teaching AI systems](https://thenewstack.io/can-self-supervised-learning-teach-ai-systems-common-sense/) how to better serve humanity, we also teach ourselves how to be more patient, curious, and emotionally intelligent.

Because the future isn’t being programmed — it’s evolving through nurture and care.
