The role of the developer is changing fast. At KubeCon North America 2025 in Atlanta, we sat down with [Emilio Salvador](https://about.gitlab.com/the-source/authors/emilio-salvador/), GitLab’s VP of Strategy and Developer Relations, to talk about his vision of how software developers will evolve from individual coders into managers of hybrid teams.

“We believe that there’s going to be more developers, but what they do is going to be more than just coding. […](%20)The developer is becoming a manager of a team that will be formed by both humans and agents,” Salvador told The New Stack.

In this episode of The New Stack Makers, we discussed how AI is reshaping developer roles, why GitLab is building an agent orchestration platform, and what the “meta agent” of the future might look like.

## Cognitive Architects and AI Guardians

In an article [Salvador published on The New Stack recently](https://thenewstack.io/whats-next-for-developer-teams-how-to-prepare-now/), he coined two terms for where developers are heading. The first, the “cognitive architect,” is about how development is becoming less about writing individual functions and more about decomposing large problems into pieces that can be assigned to AI agents or human team members.

“In the past, developers were tasked with a single thing that they needed to do — read this JSON file or parse this,” Salvador explained. “Now, the scale of the problem is much bigger, and you have to start thinking more like an architect who is going to take a much bigger problem, break it down into smaller pieces, and then assign those pieces to different agents or other team members.”

The second role, the “AI guardian,” is a bit of a reality check: developers are losing confidence in the quality of AI-generated code. Salvador pointed to large companies claiming that 80% of their code is now written by AI, yet every line of code those agents write is still reviewed by a human.

“There will be people who will oversee compliance, security, code quality — those will always be humans […],” he said. “I don’t see any European bank deploying an application that has not been signed by a person saying that the application is right.”

## The AI Paradox: Faster Coding, Same Bottlenecks

But even as developers are increasingly writing more code with the help of AI — or at least think they do — most companies haven’t really seen major productivity gains from their software teams.

GitLab calls it the “AI paradox.” Even though developers can now write code faster, those gains disappear because the rest of the software development lifecycle hasn’t caught up. Testing, security reviews and compliance are becoming the new bottlenecks.

“You can only be as fast as your slowest wheel,” Salvador said. “So when you think about implementing AI across your software development life cycle, you need to take a more strategic approach. You have to look at your entire software development life cycle and apply AI at every single stage, because otherwise you’re going to end up with those bottlenecks even if you do everything right.”

GitLab’s own Duo Agent Platform is meant to extend AI capabilities beyond coding into planning, security, compliance, and deployment. The platform is also designed for extensibility, Salvador noted, because no single vendor can keep pace with the ever-changing landscape of new AI tools and models.

“There’s a new tool, there’s a new model, there’s a new agent every week,” Salvador said. “The tool that is amazing today won’t be in the market six months from now.”

## The Meta Agent

Maybe Salvador’s most interesting prediction is the rise of what he calls the “meta agent,” a role-based AI agent that is essentially a full member of a development team, complete with an email address, phone number, and Slack handle.

“You will be able to communicate with that meta agent like you communicate with any other one of your team members,” he said. “You will be able to assign tasks and then they will act as an agent of agents.”

The idea here is that this meta agent won’t just be waiting for you to call, but would also be proactive and be monitoring applications 24/7. Ideally, it would be able to detect problems before they happen and automatically generate fixes.

## Agent Hype vs. Reality

Despite his overall vision for the field, Salvador is also aware of the slow pace of enterprise adoption. He recalled a recent visit to a large European bank still running mainframes and COBOL.

“I think there’s a ton of hype,” he said. “For enterprises, the speed of adoption is significantly slower than what we believe.”

He pointed to this year’s [Dora report from Google](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-the-2025-dora-report), which found that a year ago, productivity gains from AI were “almost insignificant.” Now the gains are there, but it took time for both the technology to improve and for developers to learn how to use it effectively.

“AI is an amazing tool, but like any other tool, you need to know how to use it,” Salvador said. “When we ignore the human factor and change management, things don’t happen overnight.”

His advice for teams getting started: think small. Pick a single application, work with a small team, and guide them through the entire lifecycle from coding to deployment.

“If you can help developers accelerate that learning process, then they will be able to spread that knowledge across your entire org,” he said.
