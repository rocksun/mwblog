AI’s [impact on the tech job market](https://thenewstack.io/ai-will-steal-developer-jobs-but-not-how-you-think/) is less disruptive than developers fear. In fact, so far it seems to be creating rather than destroying jobs, according to [a new talent survey](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/open-source-jobs-report-2025) from the [Linux Foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/course-catalog/?utm_content=inline+mention).

Participants in the foundation’s new report were four times as likely to say that AI is increasing software development jobs as compared to decreasing them. When asked about [AI’s impact on the technical workforce](https://thenewstack.io/the-field-cto-view-ai-vibe-coding-and-developer-skillsets/), 32% said it has increased the number of software development positions; only 8% cited a decline.

AI was also credited for increases in overall headcount at survey respondents’ organizations: 33% said AI is responsible for an increase in headcount in 2025, as compared to 12% saying it is causing a decline.

However, as in another recent survey — [LeadDev’s new report on engineering leadership](https://thenewstack.io/tech-hiring-improves-but-managers-overworked-says-report/) — the outlook for entry-level tech roles was more concerning.

In the Linux Foundation report, 24% of participants said they think AI has increased these types of opportunities, but 18% said AI has decreased this type of job in the technical workforce.

And 24% of respondents in the Linux Foundation survey said that many traditional entry-level tasks are now handled by AI tools.

The results in the Linux Foundation’s “2025 State of Tech Talent” report came from a survey of 556 people who either hire, train or recruit IT professionals. Twenty-nine percent were in software development and 22% were in systems operations, administration, site reliability engineering or IT service management.

## New AI-Specific Roles Emerge

An increase in AI-specific roles seems to be underlying the hiring picture, according to the Linux Foundation report:

* Overall, 57% expect to expand the number of roles that are AI-specific.
* Among those that have increased their AI-specific positions, 64% said that AI and machine learning (ML) operations engineer has emerged as a job role in their organization.

Survey participants were keen on training their current employees in AI skills. Nearly half — 49% — said they plan to upskill their existing workforce in AI to handle core AI activities.

The relative scarcity of AI-specific skills may be having an effect on retention. Excluding those that couldn’t answer the question, on average, only 19% of new hires are asked to leave within 6 months. That is down from both 39% in 2024 and 29% in 2023.

Hiring to fill a technical position is taking less time than it did in recent years, but it is still a time-consuming process. On average, according to the new report, it takes 3.7 months to fill a technical position. But that is down from both 5.4 months in 2024 and 4.6 months in 2023.
