There aren’t many companies that can say this, but it’s true: [Sightful](http://www.sightful.com/) is sitting squarely at the intersection of augmented reality, next-gen PCs, and the coming AI-powered productivity wave. The company has launched [Spacetop for Windows](https://www.sightful.com/product), a software-only version of its signature AR workspace laptop.

Best known for building the [first AR laptop in 2023](https://thenewstack.io/new-spacetop-laptop-puts-your-workspace-in-the-air/), Sightful has reengineered its virtual productivity tool to run natively on Windows [AI PCs](https://thenewstack.io/why-ai-pcs-are-not-for-developers/) — a major move from hardware toward scalable software deployment. Instead of being housed permanently in a specific mobile computer, it’s now available as [Software as a Service](https://thenewstack.io/service-as-software-how-ai-agents-are-transforming-saas/).

“Spacetop is the killer app for AI PC,” Sightful co-founder and CEO [Tamir Berliner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamirberliner/?originalSubdomain=il) told The New Stack. “Now you can take your full office — uncompromised workstation — anywhere: on a plane, the train, at your home office, or at a coffee shop. Fully secured, fully private, and also running all of your apps that you love.”

A Spacetop doesn’t need a screen to display a workspace. Instead, you slip on a pair of fashionable-looking glasses connected to the unit to observe your desktop, which is complete with all your websites and apps floating in the air before you, or wherever you turn your head. Using the keyboard as you would normally, you can check email correspondence, join a Zoom video conference, or create a memo as you would with a physical screen — only no one but you can see what you’re working on.

The new release is more than a product update. It’s a signal that AR is maturing beyond niche use cases and evolving into a practical, secure productivity layer for knowledge workers. With Spacetop for Windows, Tel Aviv-based Sightful is betting that new AI-powered PCs with integrated [NPUs](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-run-deepseek-models-locally-on-a-windows-copilot-pc/) (neural processing units) are finally ready to unlock the full potential of immersive spatial computing.

A Spacetop can be used anywhere you have connectivity, but it is especially relevant when being used on a plane or train, where there’s little room around you to maneuver a single-screen laptop. The Spacetop simply overlays all your websites and apps over flight attendants, backs of seats and other passengers in front of you. Wherever you decide to look, there’s your workspace and applications.

## AR Productivity for the AI PC Generation
The company’s early efforts focused on a full-stack solution — custom hardware paired with proprietary software — to bring productive AR to market. But with AI PC adoption starting to catch on, Sightful’s software-first pivot aligns with where the personal computing market is obviously headed.

That new market, by the way, is scaling up fast. Market intelligence firm [Canalys](https://canalys.com/) projects that nearly 20% of all PCs shipped in 2025 will be AI-capable, a figure expected to surge past 60% by 2027. These AI PCs boast new processing capabilities ideally suited for spatial computing, allowing platforms such as Spacetop to step up to the plate.

Spacetop for Windows takes full advantage of those capabilities, offering a spatial workspace that mimics a multi-monitor setup, only this one fits in a backpack. Users can float messaging apps, spreadsheets, documents, and browsers in an expansive 100-inch AR canvas, viewable only through their AR glasses. The result is a mobile, private workspace that feels like a full home office, even in public.

## Secure and Comfortable for the Road
At its core, Spacetop is about privacy and mobility. Whether users are working from a plane, a café, or a moving train, their digital workspace remains secure and invisible to others. Legal documents, sensitive data, and confidential projects stay hidden from prying eyes, addressing growing enterprise concerns over data exposure in open environments.

Key features of the Windows edition include:

- Full compatibility with business and productivity apps already in use
- An intuitive interface for spatial manipulation via keyboard gestures
- A bright, adaptive AR display that works both indoors and outdoors
- Ergonomic benefits such as reduced neck strain and eye fatigue
- Lightweight AR glasses (83g) for all-day wearability
On a personal level, I can vouch for the improved comfort of the new glasses and the many details for usability that have been added into the user interface. Neck strain is virtually non-existent and the glasses are much lighter and easier to use, especially for hours at a time. The system does take a little time “to get used to”, because it is a big departure from flat screens as we know them. But once the Spacetop becomes routine, it becomes second nature, like anything else.

The new [Spacetop Bundle](https://orders.sightful.com/products/spacetop-bundle-by-sightful), priced at $899, includes XReal Air Ultra 2 AR glasses and a 12-month software subscription (renewable at $200/year). Optional prescription lens inserts are available for additional comfort and visual clarity.

## Global Expansion, Strategic Partnerships
International availability for Spacetop started with a rollout in Germany on April 24. To support this expansion, Sightful signed a strategic distribution partnership with Deutsche Telekom, making Spacetop available to the telco giant’s large B2B customer base, Berliner said.

Spacetop leadership believes there’s a good path to success in the enterprise world. Other new alliances include a go-to-market partnership with SHI International Corp, one of the largest IT solutions providers in the U.S., and a technical collaboration with Intel to further optimize Spacetop for AI laptops built on Intel’s new-generation chipsets.

“Spacetop integrates seamlessly with two of our biggest tech partners, Microsoft and Intel,” said [Amy Troxell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-troxell-960b4812/), director at SHI. “There’s just nothing like it.”

## Optimized for the New AI Laptops
Spacetop for Windows is optimized for high-performance systems equipped with NPUs, enabling fluid, low-latency rendering of spatial work environments. Spacetop requires an Intel Core Ultra 7/9 processor with Meteor Lake architecture or newer. To ensure your computer meets the hardware requirements, [check out the tech specs here](https://www.sightful.com/product#spec).

Sightful lists the following as reference platforms:

- Dell XPS Core Ultra 7 (32GB)
- HP EliteBook
- Lenovo Yoga Slim
- ASUS Zenbook
- Acer Swift Go 14
- Microsoft Surface Pro for Business (Ultra 7)
While these systems represent today’s best-suited options, Berliner said he expects PC compatibility to grow significantly throughout 2025 and beyond.

## Building a Platform, Not Only a Product
With more than $61 million raised in venture funding from backers including Corner Ventures and Aleph, Sightful is investing in long-term platform development. The company’s roadmap includes supporting a wider range of operating systems, compute backends, and AR glasses from other manufacturers.

The founding team brings deep spatial computing expertise. Berliner is a PrimeSense and Magic Leap veteran, while COO [Tomer Kahan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomerkahan/?originalSubdomain=il) previously worked at Broadcom and N-trig (acquired by Microsoft). Their shared belief? AR isn’t just a trend; it’s the logical next step in the evolution of personal computing.

“Massive companies like Apple, Meta, and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) all seem to agree that AR is the future,” Kahan said. “But we’re focused on delivering value now. Spacetop is for people who need to work — securely, comfortably, and powerfully — today.”

## What’s Next?
For early adopters and enterprises alike, Spacetop for Windows offers a new frontier in mobile productivity — one that reimagines the screen, redefines the desk, and reclaims privacy in open environments. With support from global players like Intel and Deutsche Telekom, and as the AI PC revolution continues, Sightful is in a good position for shaping the way people work in the spatial computing era.

“Spacetop is exactly why AI PCs were designed,” Berliner said. “It shows the true power of the architecture.”
