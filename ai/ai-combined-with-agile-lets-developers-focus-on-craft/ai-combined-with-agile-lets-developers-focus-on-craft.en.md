Speed isn’t the end-all, be-all for [agile programming](https://thenewstack.io/has-agile-programming-lost-its-way/), but it certainly doesn’t hurt. AI can be a resource for generating that speed while also simplifying certain facets of agile development, said [Shannon Mason](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heyshannon/), the chief strategy officer at project management solution provider [Tempo Software](https://www.tempo.io/).

“Now we have the ability to structure almost the full conceptualization of something with the help of AI, and that’s awesome,” she said. “Our job is to look to see how it [agile] can improve. And I think that’s actually where AI starts to come in the positive side. It allows us to do a lot of things that are core and fundamental to agile processes a lot faster.”

Tempo Software is creating a system to support eliminating [waste within its process](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-automate-your-wasteful-processes/). It requires complicated math and they wanted to test that before spending an inordinate amount of time, effort and energy on building out the technology system.

“Back in the day, that was something that we would have sat down; we would have planned it into the sprint,” said Mason. “It would have potentially taken more than a couple of sprints to get to a place where we actually had a comfortable prototype that was demonstrable software, that was more expansive than doing a really fast innovation sprint, like a quick sprint where we spend a week, and our goal is to get to demonstrable software.”

With AI, they were able to do the work faster, she said. It can incorporate and help explain some things that might be opaque, both internally and externally, she said.

## Supporting AI and Agile

AI is, without a doubt, the smartest toddler in the room … but it’s still a toddler and requires tempered, smart adoption, Mason said. Agile practitioners must be aware of AI’s limitations, she cautioned.

“What it is not building is scalable, extremely thoughtful and secure software,” Mason added. “It’s just like a little child — you’ve got to start forming it into what you want it to grow into.”

I shared with Mason the [story of a senior developer,](https://catskull.net/what-the-hell-is-going-on-right-now.html?) “[AI contrarian,](https://thenewstack.io/ai-contrarians-on-the-problems-with-vibe-coding/)” who kept getting bad AI-generated code from [junior developers](https://thenewstack.io/3-ways-organizations-can-redefine-the-developer-experience/). He was frustrated because when he sent back suggestions and changes, the junior developers turned it into another AI prompt, which led to more bad code he had to review.

“I do worry about newly entering engineers into the market, because if you’re producing junk code that ends up having to get optimized by your senior engineers, that also has the benefit now of being able to truly define and delineate where the AI is going to be active, then you become kind of a drag on the system,” she said. “That is antithetical to agility.”

She would ask the organization if it has an internal process for helping people understand how to [leverage AI tools as engineers](https://thenewstack.io/how-webflow-got-89-of-its-engineers-to-use-ai-daily/).

“As a [principle of agile practices](https://agilemanifesto.org/), learning and continuous learning is supposed to be part of it,” she said.

It’s also important for beginning developers to really teach themselves how these things work and to learn the language, so they’re not producing junk code. Developers should also learn about security issues created by AI, such as [injection attacks](https://thenewstack.io/when-prompt-injections-attack-bing-and-ai-vulnerabilities/), she added.

“I’m going to need to understand how injection works, so that I’m not actually deploying things where people could then [maliciously use a bot](https://thenewstack.io/theyre-among-us-malicious-bots-hide-using-nlp-and-ai/) or an agent to go in and have access to things that they absolutely shouldn’t have,” she said. “These are all things that are now getting documented because the use is becoming far more pervasive.”

## Using AI With Agile

The key to success with using AI in agile is to focus on offloading tasks that take the developer away from their craft, Mason said.

“Agile and AI really can partner together quite nicely,” she said. “The thing I think most organizations should focus on first is how do you remove tedium from your day.”

Developers can use AI to automate tasks such as generating documentation or writing internal blogs posts, tasks that take developers out of the coding flow state, she added.

“Documentation is great … but at the same time, can we use any of the [large language models](https://thenewstack.io/what-large-language-models-can-do-well-now-and-what-they-cant/) that are out there and AI to actually do or offload that work, or at least to give us the start so that it doesn’t take us a whole day,” she said.

It can also be used to provide status updates by acting as an intelligent agent within a system, such as Jira or Slack, to track progress and provide real-time, objective data on a team’s progress, she added. It can look through pull requests and deliverables from the previous day. And if developers are uncomfortable using AI to handle the task, AI can at least provide a starting place.

“You can add in the expertise, the nuance, or the things that it’s going to potentially miss,” Mason said.

It can also help developers translate technical decisions into business lexicon for users and leaders, she added.

“I don’t have an MBA. That’s not my landscape, I didn’t come from that world,” she said. But it is a world that many business users and leaders come from and understand, and Mason has to interact with them in a way they understand. “I use AI to democratize my experience with them, because I want to speak this similar language, or I want them to come over into my technical language,” she continued.

AI is also helpful in finding problems within code, Mason contends. One company had a complicated [frontend that developers](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-frontend-development) had to pull in locally in order to work on — and it was massive, she said. Using AI to narrow down where the [developer needed to focus](https://thenewstack.io/ai-development-needs-to-focus-more-on-data-less-on-models/) saved a ton of time.

Finally, AI can ensure agile doesn’t become a performance ritual rather than a process that focuses on improvement, by providing facts and data about the process that takes the personal sting out of issues.

“We actually have an agent that we developed for Jira that talks about how the sprint is progressing and gives that information in a very objective way,” she said. “Then we can use that data to make better decisions.”
