You know your organization needs to start leveraging generative AI (GenAI). But how do you get started? With data stored in databases holding your company‚Äôs critical information, applying
[large language models (LLMs)](https://thenewstack.io/llm/) to that data might seem complex. However, you can actually start using LLMs to analyze your data in Oracle Autonomous Database in just minutes using [SQL](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-write-sql-queries/)-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
## What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
RAG allows you to apply the power of LLMs (e.g., creativity, deep understanding of language nuances) to information that the models know little or nothing about. That lack of knowledge might be because the information is private (e.g., in your database) or more recent than the model‚Äôs training data. By augmenting AI-generated content with authoritative information, RAG can help
[improve the accuracy, relevance, and reliability of GenAI output](https://thenewstack.io/retrieval-augmented-generation-for-llms/).
RAG is generally associated with
[vector databases](https://thenewstack.io/vector-databases-where-geometry-meets-machine-learning/), which help provide context to an LLM by allowing super-fast retrieval of similar data from storage engines (e.g., unstructured data, PDFs, documents), rather than just exact keyword matches. To gain insights using RAG:
- Define your task using natural language.
- Perform a vector similarity search against your data to get context.
- Pass that information to the LLM.
You can now answer a natural language question like: ‚ÄúMy customer thinks this condo is beautiful. What other condos in the Boston area look like that one and are in her price range?‚Äù That returns similar-looking homes that she can afford based on image similarity and her private financial information contained in the database.
## What Is SQL-Powered RAG?
There are other ways to provide context to an LLM that are simpler but perhaps not as powerful as what‚Äôs described above. This approach works with the data that‚Äôs accessible to your Autonomous Database deployment (e.g., internal tables, data lakes, linked tables). To use RAG with Autonomous Database:
- Define your task using natural language.
- Provide a SQL query against your data to get context.
- Pass that information to the LLM.
Conceptually, this looks very similar to using RAG with vector databases. Here‚Äôs an example of applying those steps in Autonomous Database using a sample Oracle APEX app.
## Using SQL-Powered RAG
Autonomous Database provides a capability called Select AI that allows you to use LLMs with your data. A popular way to use Select AI is for natural language queries (see
[Autonomous Database speaks ‚ÄúHuman‚Äù](https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/post/autonomous-database-speaks-human?source=:ex:pw:::::&SC=:ex:pw:::::&pcode=) and [Conversations Are the Next Generation in Natural Language Queries](https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/post/conversations-are-the-next-generation-in-natural-language-queries?source=:ex:pw:::::TNS2&SC=:ex:pw:::::TNS2&pcode=)).
This is a little different than natural language queries; instead of generating a query, it combines the results of a SQL query with task instructions to produce a prompt. That prompt is passed to an LLM and processed, producing a recommendation, a summary or whatever your project asked it to do. To make this work:
- Connect Autonomous Database to an LLM, such as Cohere on OCI Generative AI.
- Use natural language to tell the LLM what you want to accomplish.
- Define a query that has the information you want to analyze.
- Package the data and the instructions into an ‚Äúaugmented‚Äù prompt.
- Send the augmented prompt to the LLM and get your results.
Following are code examples for each of these steps. Check out this
[LiveLabs workshop](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3910) if you want to run the steps on your own.
### 1. Connect Autonomous Database to an LLM
Select AI uses an AI profile to encapsulate connection information to an AI provider. Create a profile using the
[DBMS_CLOUD_AI.create_profile PLSQL procedure](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/serverless/adbsb/dbms-cloud-ai-package.html#GUID-D51B04DE-233B-48A2-BBFA-3AAB18D8C35C):
- This profile connects to OCI Generative AI, but you can connect to other providers such as OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.
- OCI Generative AI supports multiple models; the above connects to the cohere.command LLM.
- A credential is used to sign the request. This uses an Autonomous Database
[resource principal](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/serverless/adbsb/resource-principal.html#GUID-E283804C-F266-4DFB-A9CF-B098A21E496A), which means your database instance needs access to the OCI Generative AI service using an identity management (IAM) policy. For services like Azure OpenAI, the credential must be created using your secret API key.
### 2. Use Natural Language to Tell the LLM What You Want to Do
There is an emerging science around
[prompt engineering](https://roadmap.sh/prompt-engineering) trying to answer the question: ‚ÄúWhat is the best way to give instructions to the LLM?‚Äù You will want to test different prompts to see what gives the best results. Here‚Äôs an example:
Pick 5 great things to do at the location
- Encourage the customer to do these recommendations.
- Take into account all the information about the customer that‚Äôs provided, including family or dog situations, whether or not they have a car and their income level.
- Format the result with emojis and make it fun.
### 3. Define a Query with the Information You Want to Analyze
The LLM has no knowledge about the person traveling to that location. Supply a database query that augments the instructions with the traveler‚Äôs profile:
### 4. Package the Data and Instructions into an Augmented Prompt
You want to provide clear instructions to the LLM to help it produce the best results. Supplying a JSON document is a great way to organize those instructions, and it‚Äôs incredibly easy to
[package SQL queries as JSON](https://thenewstack.io/why-and-how-you-should-manage-json-with-sql/) using Autonomous Database‚Äôs built-in JSON_OBJECT function:
This query returns a well-structured JSON document:
### 5. Send the Augmented Prompt to the LLM and Get Your Results
Select AI provides a simple function,
[DBMS_CLOUD_AI.GENERATE](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/serverless/adbsb/dbms-cloud-ai-package.html#GUID-7B438E87-0E9A-4318-BA01-3BE1A5851229), to communicate with the LLM. It uses the profile(s) created previously, making it easy to test results from different providers:
