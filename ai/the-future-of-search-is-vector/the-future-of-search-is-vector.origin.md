Nearly 90% of users [will not return to a site](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/website-statistics/) if they have a bad experience. Take a moment to appreciate that staggering statistic. Site reliability engineers are traditionally focused on the “five 9s,” ensuring a website remains up and accessible 99.999% of the time. Yet that is only a part of the picture for guaranteeing a positive user experience. What else can cause a user to click away from a site and never return?

Not being able to discover what they were looking for.

The frustration of searching for something but being unable to find it quickly and efficiently may be one of the most disappointing experiences for users. You want to build a site where that rarely happens. However, users make it very hard. Oftentimes, they do not know what exactly they are looking for. They have a picture in their mind of what they want but lack the precise terms, and their search ends up being submitted with keywords such as “the thing that tightens screws.” A human respondent to that search will return an index of screwdrivers. What will your keyword-based search return?

- Articles about tightening techniques.
- Blog posts on different types of screws.
- Tools that have nothing to do with screwdrivers.
This example happens all the time, every single day, countless times a day.

Facing this dilemma requires a new resource to improve the user experience and bring clarity even when users lack it. Vector search offers possibilities that are not feasible with traditional keyword search alone.

## How Vector Search Works
Vector search leverages advanced machine learning models to transform textual data into high-dimensional vectors, capturing semantic relationships between words and phrases. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, which relies on exact matches, vector search understands the context and meaning behind queries, allowing it to retrieve more relevant results. By mapping queries and documents into the same vector space, it measures their similarity, enabling precise and intuitive search experiences even when the user’s input is imprecise or vague. This approach significantly enhances the accuracy and relevance of search results, making it a powerful tool for modern information retrieval systems.

In other words, when a user searches for “the thing that tightens screws” in a search functionality powered by vector search, the system doesn’t just look for documents containing those exact words. Instead, it interprets the meaning behind the query and identifies relevant documents that include “screwdriver” and related terms.

By understanding the context and semantics, vector search delivers results that are highly relevant to the user’s intent, even if the exact keyword is not in the query. This capability makes vector search an invaluable tool for improving user experience by providing precise and accurate search results in response to imprecise or descriptive queries.

## A Simple Vector Search Example
Turning data into vectors involves the process of embedding, where textual data is converted into numerical representations in a high-dimensional space. A vector, in this context, is a mathematical entity that captures the semantic meaning of words and phrases by representing them as points in a multidimensional space. By embedding words into vectors, models can measure the similarity between different terms based on their context and usage in large datasets. This transformation allows more nuanced and context-aware search functionalities, paving the way for advancements in information retrieval and artificial intelligence.

To provide an overly simple example, say the dataset that the search functionality is based on was only a string composed of “Your text string goes here.” This string would be [converted into vectors](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings) of numerical representations of the words within the string. The embeddings would include values such as:

- -0.006929283495992422
- -0.005336422007530928
- -4.547132266452536e-05
- -0.024047505110502243
These vectors represent the semantic meaning of the words and allow the search functionality to understand and retrieve relevant information based on context rather than just exact keyword matches.

When a user searches for a phrase like “what data type goes in this field?” using this simplistic dataset, the search engine converts the query into a vector representation. It then compares this query vector with the dataset’s vectors. Even though the exact words “what data type goes in this field?” are not in the sample dataset, the vector search identifies that the query’s context and semantics are similar to “Your text string goes here.” Therefore, the search engine can return the most relevant result based on the similarity of the vectors. This effectively transforms uncertain and unclear user queries into results with more certainty and more clarity.

## How to Store and Retrieve Vector Embeddings
The best results are useful only if they can be stored and retrieved quickly and cost-effectively. As a site’s data continues to grow, so will the vector embeddings that need to be stored and retrieved, so any solution must also be highly scalable.

A generic database solution, either on premises or in the cloud, is not appropriate for vector search needs. The database must be specialized in order to handle the high-dimensional nature of embeddings efficiently, support rapid similarity searches and optimize storage for large volumes of vectors. This specialization ensures that the search system remains performant and responsive, providing users with relevant results in [real time even as data scales](https://thenewstack.io/integrating-real-time-and-historical-data-enhances-decision-making/).

Any vector search database solution should offer advanced indexing capabilities, support multiple data types and integrate with popular [AI frameworks and tools for generating](https://thenewstack.io/using-real-time-data-to-unify-generative-and-predictive-ai/) embeddings. An essential but often overlooked requirement is the ability to provide a quality search experience in offline environments, known as delivering [computing “on the edge.”](https://thenewstack.io/edge-computing/what-is-edge-computing/)

Will integrating vector search into a site solve all problems and resolve all frustrations for users? Absolutely not. Will it go a long way in providing a more excellent and seamless experience for users? Without a doubt, the answer is yes. Give vector search a chance, and help make sure your users return a second time to your site.
