Being on call has long been a rite of passage for engineers, marked by late-night alerts, sleep deprivation and the risk of burnout. But firefighting at 3 a.m. isn’t the reason engineers became engineers.

As digital systems grow more complex, the pressure only increases. The good news is that AI and agentic automation are quietly reshaping every stage of the on-call experience, offering IT operations teams real relief where it’s needed most.

## **Before the Incident: AI Combats On-Call Anxiety**

The anxiety before an on-call shift can be as draining as the shift itself, especially for less-experienced engineers. With AI surfacing context, providing resources and historical data, and even handling triage and root cause analysis, engineers can begin their shifts with confidence knowing they won’t be walking into the unknown at 3 a.m. The result is less pre-shift dread, more peace of mind and a stronger sense of support before the first alert fires.

Agentic AI also addresses a classic pain point: scheduling. Traditional scheduling is often manual, and keeping it up to date for PTO, holidays or emergency coverage can be a challenge. Today, AI agents resolve scheduling conflicts, ensure seamless coverage and adapt to last-minute changes automatically, which means [teams are more prepared before an incident](https://thenewstack.io/what-can-incident-teams-learn-from-crisis-management/) even happens.

However, the real transformation occurs when an incident strikes and every second counts.

## **During: AI Handles Routine, Engineers Handle the Unknown**

[Incident response is the heart of being on call](https://thenewstack.io/tech-debt-incidents-and-on-call/), and this is where AI and agents have the biggest impact.

Gone are the days of jumping between dashboards, manually triaging alerts and piecing together context from scattered sources. Now, AI and automation play a crucial role across the spectrum of incidents:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Incident type** | **How AI and agents help** |
| Well-understood | Detect, triage and remediate end-to-end with no human wake-up needed. |
| Partially understood | Triage, run diagnostics and present remediation options for human review. |
| New or novel | Triage alerts, surface context and act as a scribe, freeing humans to focus on creative and complex problem solving. |

* **Well-understood incidents:** These are the recurring issues with known solutions. Here, automation and AI can handle detection, triage and remediation from start to finish. The system recognizes the pattern, applies the fix and closes the loop without the need to wake anyone up. For on-call teams, this means fewer interruptions and more restful nights.
* **Partially understood incidents:** Sometimes, the system knows what’s wrong but isn’t sure of the best fix. In these cases, AI and automation handle the heavy lifting: triaging the incident, running diagnostics and presenting multiple remediation paths. The responder reviews the options, selects the best course of action and, in some cases, AI can even carry out the response from there. This partnership reduces cognitive load and speeds up resolution while still keeping humans in control.
* **New or novel incidents:** When something truly unexpected happens, human expertise is irreplaceable. But even in these scenarios, AI and agents are invaluable teammates. They triage incoming alerts, surface relevant context and act as a scribe by capturing key actions and decisions in real time. This support lets engineers focus on creative problem-solving, not administrative overhead.

Throughout all of this, collaboration tools and integrations keep everyone aligned. The modern on-call experience is more connected and less chaotic than ever before.

But the story doesn’t end when the incident is resolved. In fact, that’s where the next chapter of improvement begins.

## **After the Incident: AI Turns Every Incident Into Progress**

Post-incident reviews are critical for learning and improvement, but they’re often time-consuming and inconsistent.

AI is changing that.

AI-drafted post-incident reviews now capture what happened, summarize key actions and highlight lessons learned, without manual note-taking or endless meetings. This means that engineers no longer need to create the scaffolding and instead can focus on unexpected outcomes or novel learnings.

Beyond documentation, AI-driven insights identify recurring patterns, recommend [process improvements and even suggest new automations](https://thenewstack.io/five-ways-process-automation-can-streamline-itops/) to prevent similar incidents in the future. The result is a virtuous cycle: Each incident not only makes the system stronger, but also makes the team more resilient, with less manual effort required. It’s a process that makes on-call life better each time you complete it.

## **The Future of On Call: Healthier Teams, Smarter Systems**

Being on call doesn’t have to be a source of dread.

With AI and agentic automation, practitioners are gaining real allies in tools that handle the repetitive, the routine and the well-understood, while empowering humans to focus on what they do best. The future of being on call is healthier teams, faster response and a [culture of continuous improvement](https://thenewstack.io/three-ways-automation-can-improve-workplace-culture/).

The era of AI-powered operations is here, and it’s making life better for everyone on the front lines.
