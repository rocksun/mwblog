Dr. Shane C. Archiquette

### 1. Executive Summary
In today’s rapidly evolving IT landscape, AIOps is revolutionizing how organizations manage and resolve complex IT issues. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data analytics, AIOps drives efficiency and innovation by automating the identification and resolution of common IT problems.

A significant advancement in AIOps is the integration of generative AI and large language models (LLMs), which serve as force multipliers. These technologies empower organizations to navigate the complexities of modern IT environments more effectively. AIOps extends its impact beyond traditional IT boundaries to encompass overall business operations by enabling businesses to query the IT organization and receive contextually relevant responses.

The journey to AIOps begins with monitoring, progresses through observability, and culminates in intelligence (see **Figure 1**). Monitoring has become a staple in ITOps, providing visibility into devices, applications, and infrastructure. Observability takes this a step further by consolidating data to derive meaningful insights, predict future states, and automatically remediate known issues.

*Figure 1. From Monitoring to Intelligence*
Intelligence represents the pinnacle of this evolution, reflecting the operational state of the entire company. It leverages comprehensive data from various departments—marketing, sales, legal, human resources, and manufacturing—to deliver on the promise of AIOps. This holistic approach allows organizations to answer critical questions about the company’s status, predict the impact of business initiatives, and adapt to planned and unplanned changes.

With the rise of cyberthreats, integrating security and compliance features within AIOps platforms has become paramount. Real-time threat detection and response, facilitated by SIEM and SOAR, are now integral to operational management, ensuring robust security measures.

The complexity of IT systems, characterized by multicloud infrastructures and microservices, necessitates advanced AIOps solutions to manage vast data volumes. However, seamless integration with existing IT tools and systems remains a challenge. Vendors that offer solutions requiring minimal customization and integration effort, as well as those that lower the expertise threshold in AI/ML and data analytics, will likely see greater adoption.

As we delve into the landscape of AIOps vendors, we will explore how they address these challenges and evaluate their capabilities in transforming IT operations.

This is our fifth year evaluating the AIOps space in the context of our Key Criteria and Radar reports. This report builds on our [previous analysis](https://gigaom.com/report/gigaom-radar-for-aiops-2/) and considers how the market has evolved over the last year.

This GigaOm Radar report examines 29 of the top AIOps solutions and compares offerings against the capabilities (table stakes, key features, and emerging features) and nonfunctional requirements (business criteria) outlined in the companion Key Criteria report. Together, these reports provide an overview of the market, identify leading AIOps offerings, and help decision-makers evaluate these solutions so they can make a more informed investment decision.

#### GIGAOM KEY CRITERIA AND RADAR REPORTS
The GigaOm Key Criteria report provides a detailed decision framework for IT and executive leadership assessing enterprise technologies. Each report defines relevant functional and nonfunctional aspects of solutions in a sector. The Key Criteria report informs the GigaOm Radar report, which provides a forward-looking assessment of vendor solutions in the sector.

### 2. Market Categories and Deployment Types
To help prospective customers find the best fit for their use case and business requirements, we assess how well AIOps solutions are designed to serve specific target markets and deployment models (**Table 1**).

For this report, we recognize the following market segments:

**Small-to-medium business (SMB):**In this category, we assess solutions on their ability to meet the needs of small and medium-sized organizations. Also assessed are departmental use cases in large enterprises where ease of use and deployment are more important than extensive management functionality, data mobility, and feature set.**Large enterprise:**Here, offerings are assessed on their ability to support large and business-critical projects. Optimal solutions in this category strongly focus on flexibility, performance, data services, and features to improve security and data protection. Scalability is another big differentiator, as is the ability to deploy the same service in different environments.**Service provider:**These providers deliver on-demand, pay-per-use services to customers over the internet, including infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS).
In addition, we recognize the following deployment models:

**Cloud:**The solution is hosted and managed by the vendor in the cloud, providing scalability without requiring local infrastructure.**On-premises**: These solutions are deployed on customer-owned infrastructure and managed by the customer.**Hybrid**: These solutions are meant to be installed on-premises and in the cloud, allowing organizations to build hybrid or multicloud infrastructures. Integration with a single cloud provider could be limited compared to the other options and more complex to deploy and manage. On the other hand, this approach is more flexible, and the user usually has more control over the entire stack regarding resource allocation and tuning.
*Table 1. Vendor Positioning: Target Market and Deployment Model*
**Table 1** components are evaluated in a binary yes/no manner and do not factor into a vendor’s designation as a Leader, Challenger, or Entrant on the Radar chart (**Figure 1**).
“Target market” reflects which use cases each solution is recommended for, not simply whether that group can use it. For example, if an SMB could use a solution but doing so would be cost-prohibitive, that solution would be rated “no” for SMBs.

### 3. Decision Criteria Comparison
All solutions included in this Radar report meet the following table stakes—capabilities widely adopted and well implemented in the sector:

Real-time monitoring

Predictive capabilities

Root cause analysis

IT operations integrations

Security and compliance

Authorization, access, and authentication

Visualizations and dashboards

**Tables 2, 3, and 4** summarize how each vendor in this research performs in the areas we consider differentiating and critical in this sector. The objective is to give the reader a snapshot of the technical capabilities of available solutions, define the perimeter of the relevant market space, and gauge the potential impact on the business.
Key features differentiate solutions, highlighting the primary criteria for evaluating an AIOps solution.

Emerging features show how well each vendor implements capabilities that are not yet mainstream but are expected to become more widespread and compelling within the next 12 to 18 months.

Business criteria provide insight into the nonfunctional requirements that factor into a purchase decision and determine a solution’s impact on an organization.

These decision criteria are summarized below. The corresponding report, “[GigaOm Key Criteria for Evaluating AIOps Solutions](https://gigaom.com/report/gigaom-key-criteria-for-evaluating-aiops-solutions/),” provides more detailed descriptions.

### Key Features
**Data aggregation and normalization:**This feature refers to a solution’s ability to ingest, aggregate, and normalize data from any source anywhere with minimal effort. The use of a low-code/no-code ingestion method is ideal. The solution should ensure compatibility with various data sources, including cloud and on-premises infrastructure, applications, and various monitoring tools.**Advanced analytics:**Advanced analytics with anomaly detection systems identify and analyze deviations from normal behavior to provide a foundation for predictive insights and proactive management. Algorithms must be continuously trained, and ML models must be fine-tuned on diverse datasets to ensure the accuracy and relevance of analytics, adapting to changes in the IT environment and operational patterns.**Anomaly detection:**Anomaly detection uses real-time processing algorithms to recognize complex patterns and subtle anomalies that may indicate emerging issues or optimization opportunities. The solution should allow the customization of detection thresholds and parameters to accommodate the particular characteristics and requirements of different IT environments and applications.**Correlation and causality analysis:**A key to the success of any AIOps solution is multidimensional correlation, which analyzes data across multiple dimensions, such as time, geography, and infrastructure layers, to accurately identify correlations and causal relationships between disparate events.**Automated remediation:**Orchestration and automation can resolve incidents automatically, whether with a native engine or integration with an external tool. Three types of automated remediation are expected: policy-based automation, which implements frameworks that allow IT teams to define rules and conditions under which remediation actions are triggered; actionable remediation, which ensures remediation actions are precise, can be implemented, and are tailored to the specific issue, minimizing the risk of unintended consequences and enabling quick resolution of problems; and remediation that includes feedback loops that monitor the outcome of automated remediation actions, allowing the system to learn from successes and failures and continuously improve its effectiveness.**Collaboration and workflow integration:**AIOps tools should seamlessly integrate with existing IT service management (ITSM), DevOps tools, and collaboration platforms (like Teams and Slack), allowing efficient workflow management and information-sharing across teams. Automated triggers should enable the initiation of workflows based on insights and anomalies detected by the AIOps platform, streamlining the response process and reducing manual intervention.**SIEM and SOAR integration:**SIEM and SOAR solutions play crucial roles in the broader IT security landscape, and their relevance to AIOps is increasingly significant. Integrating SIEM and SOAR within AIOps platforms enables organizations to leverage advanced analytics, ML, and automation not just for operational efficiency and reliability but also for detecting, analyzing, and responding to security threats in real time.
*Table 2. Key Features Comparison*
### Emerging Features
**Edge AI:**Edge AI enables real-time, localized decision-making and analytics at the network’s edge, reduces latency and bandwidth use, and improves data privacy and security. This emerging technology focuses on developing lightweight, efficient AI models and hardware capable of processing complex computations on edge devices.**Automated causal inference:**Advancements in ML algorithms for better causal analysis and the integration of explainable AI can make insights actionable and understandable for IT operators. This shift from correlation-based insights to understanding cause and effect relationships enables precise problem diagnosis and effective, proactive IT operations management.**Predictive security posture management:**Predictive security posture elevates cybersecurity within IT operations by using AI to predict and prevent security threats before they occur, aligning operational resilience with security. PSPM leverages advanced ML for anomaly detection and integrates real-time threat intelligence for dynamic risk assessment and mitigation strategies.**Business data integration:**AIOps presents an opportunity to combine IT operations with business objectives by incorporating business metrics (sales, customer behavior, and more) into operational decision-making, enhancing the strategic impact of IT operations. AIOps can process and analyze IT and business data in a unified manner, supported by AI-driven insights for cross-functional optimization.**Generative AI:**Generative AI (GenAI) refers to a class of artificial intelligence models that can generate new content, such as text, images, music, or even videos, that is often indistinguishable from content created by humans. These models are typically based on deep learning architectures, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and LLMs like GPT (generative pretrained transformer).**Ghost change detection:**The most common cause of incidents is a change in the hardware or software environment. Change management captures changes made within known processes; however, changes made outside of approved processes—ghost changes—contribute equally to incidents. Without ghost change detection, the business continues to be at risk of interruption.
*Table 3. Emerging Features Comparison*
### Business Criteria
**Ease of deployment:**Ease of deployment refers to the simplicity and speed with which an AIOps solution can be implemented within an organization’s IT infrastructure. This includes integrating with current systems, migrating data, and configuring the solution to meet specific operational requirements without significant downtime or disruptions. A solution that is easy to deploy reduces the time and resources required to get it up and running, thereby accelerating the realization of benefits from the investment.**Ease of use:**Ease of use refers to the user-friendliness of the AIOps platform, including its interface design, intuitiveness, and the simplicity of managing its operations. It also encompasses the learning curve for IT staff and the availability of support and training resources. Easy-to-use solutions can enhance productivity, reduce the likelihood of user errors, and decrease the need for extensive training, making it easier for teams to adopt and leverage the platform effectively.**Flexibility:**This criterion refers to the capability of an AIOps solution to quickly adapt to changes in the IT environment, including scaling to accommodate growth, integrating with new technologies, and updating to include new features or address emerging challenges. Flexibility ensures that the AIOps platform can continue to meet an organization’s needs over time, supporting continuous improvement and innovation in IT operations.**Vendor ecosystem:**A vendor’s ecosystem encompasses the network of partnerships, integrations, and third-party solutions available with the AIOps platform. This includes the ability of the solution to integrate with the organization’s existing IT management tools, cloud services, and other technologies, along with training, certifications, community tools, and professional services. A robust vendor ecosystem extends the functionality of the AIOps solution, facilitating seamless data exchange and operational workflows across a diverse IT landscape, thereby enhancing the overall value and effectiveness of the platform.**Cost**: Cost management in AIOps involves evaluating the expenses associated with core features, scaling, and integrations. Prospective customers should consider feature costs, including any necessary modules or add-ons; evaluate scalability in terms of how the solution accommodates increased data and user demands without significant additional costs; and review integration, customization, and training and support costs as they affect the overall operational budget.**Compliance management:**Compliance auditing and reporting facilitate the process of audits and generate reports to demonstrate compliance with relevant regulations and standards, such as SOC 2, HIPAA, or ISO 27001. This management capability includes tools for flagging and alerting violations, creating, managing, and enforcing security policies across the organization, and ensuring consistent adherence to security best practices and regulatory requirements.
*Table 4. Business Criteria Comparison*
### 4. GigaOm Radar
The GigaOm Radar plots vendor solutions across a series of concentric rings, with those set closer to the center judged to be of higher overall value. The chart characterizes each vendor on two axes—balancing Maturity versus Innovation and Feature Play versus Platform Play—while providing an arrowhead that projects each solution’s evolution over the coming 12 to 18 months.

*Figure 2. GigaOm Radar for AIOps*
In the Radar chart in **Figure 2**, vendors are positioned across quadrants based on the following:

**Maturity/Feature Play**Vendors in this quadrant have a specific strength or focus in their approach to the AIOps market and the end-user organizations they service. Specific focus areas include detection, analysis, and remediation of issues captured by the AIOps tools as well as AIOps solutions tailored to drive specific value to verticals like banking or telecom organizations. Given the large challenge that organizations face in ensuring that AIOps tools can fully comprehend all data sources in an organization, this specificity can drive value to end users.
**Maturity/Platform Play**As might be expected given the established nature of the AIOps market, there is a strong concentration of vendors with broad approaches and highly developed solutions with comprehensive feature sets in this quadrant. These vendors are making incremental improvements to their solutions, which largely includes adding sophistication to the AI models, which in turn drives the effectiveness of most key features we evaluated. Vendors in this quadrant are less focused on emerging features, and are more likely to wait for demonstrated market value of the newer technologies before investing in these technologies.
**Innovation/Platform Play**Vendors in this quadrant offer broad solutions with comprehensive feature sets, but there’s likely to be moderate to significant change in the solution over a typical contract lifecycle. These vendors are prioritizing addressing the emerging needs of their users and have aggressive roadmaps to prove it. Vendors in this quadrant are mostly focused on developing the emerging features we evaluated, with notable concentration in GenAI capabilities and business data integration.
**Innovation/Feature Play**This quadrant houses vendors that have more unique approaches to AIOps and are targeting emerging use cases such as edge AI. These vendors are flexible and responsive to user needs: they offer solutions that are in active development and still evolving.
In reviewing solutions, it’s important to remember that there are no universal “best” or “worst” offerings; every solution has aspects that might make it a better or worse fit for specific customer requirements. Prospective customers should consider their current and future needs when comparing solutions and vendor roadmaps.

#### INSIDE THE GIGAOM RADAR
To create the GigaOm Radar graphic, key features, emerging features, and business criteria are scored and weighted. Key features and business criteria receive the highest weighting and have the most impact on vendor positioning on the Radar graphic. Emerging features receive a lower weighting and have a lower impact on vendor positioning on the Radar graphic. The resulting chart is a forward-looking perspective on all the vendors in this report, based on their products’ technical capabilities and roadmaps.Note that the Radar is technology-focused, and business considerations such as vendor market share, customer share, spend, recency or longevity in the market, and so on are not considered in our evaluations. As such, these factors do not impact scoring and positioning on the Radar graphic.For more information, please visit our [Methodology](https://gigaom.com/kcr-methodology/).

### 5. Solution Insights
### BigPanda: AIOps
**Solution Overview**BigPanda’s AIOps solution is an event management platform designed to help organizations identify and resolve common and complex IT issues with an ITSM framework. Its Automated Incident Analysis (AIA), which is an add-on feature, is powered by GenAI. It uses an LLM that enables natural language interaction to enhance incident response, find the probable root cause of an incident, identify other abilities, and speed up the time to remediation. The AI capabilities are also used to create short and meaningful incident titles and summaries, which are shown on dashboards and can be used to display additional information.
BigPanda AIOps is also an algorithmic event correlation platform that can ingest any type of data from any source, including business alerts, using webhooks and their API. Business events and alerts may require initial tagging or other correlation data to provide meaningful insights. The native automation engine allows remediation, collaboration with external tools, and workflow optimization.

**Strengths**BigPanda is data agnostic, meaning it does not require displacing existing tools. Moreover, data-agnostic solutions are very good at anomaly detection, and the ability to handle data from any vendor or business source fosters the development of overall intelligence. The built-in automation engine facilitates the automated remediation of incidents and streamlines workflow between BigPanda and external tools such as Teams, Slack, or an ITSM system. The workflow interface enables automation and workflows to be configured and modified easily.
BigPanda is also easy to deploy and use. It’s a flexible solution with a strong vendor ecosystem. Administrators and users see a simple and consistent interface requiring little training. Flexibility is enhanced by the easy integration with any data set and the ability to run BigPanda as a SaaS application. BigPanda does a good job of compliance management but can’t send alerts on compliance violations.

**Challenges**BigPanda has lower scores in SIEM and SOAR integration–though it can integrate with SIEM and SOAR solutions, it provides no direct support for them. Moreover, it has not yet incorporated some of the emerging technologies we noted above, including edge AI and predictive security posture management, which have yet to solidify in the industry. At the same time, BigPanda’s integration of business data and GenAI is keeping up with the marketplace and it could actually exceed the market in GenAI if more concrete definitions of average were available.
Detection of ghost changes is also lacking. Changes to infrastructure and topology can be seen, but configuration and code changes can’t. Therefore, the solution can’t see the system and software parameters or any configuration changes.

**Purchase Considerations**BigPanda is deployed as a SaaS application> It comes with regional support for North America and Europe and provides full GDPR compliance.
BigPanda is a strong player in data-agnostic AIOps, where the focus is on pulling alerts, events, and other information to provide an intelligent overview of the enterprise. If observability tooling already exists, BigPanda should be a consideration. The enterprise needs only to send data to BigPanda without changing how development teams operate. Additional tagging helps, but most observability tools already provide these for use by DevOps and others. BigPanda makes intelligence about the enterprise more accessible.

BigPanda is a general-purpose AIOps solution applicable to multiple use cases such as network operations centers, ITSM incident problem management, and observability. The SaaS implementation is well suited to organizations of any size. The target market for BigPanda includes SMBs, ISVs, large enterprises, and service providers.

**Radar Chart Overview**BigPanda is positioned in the Maturity/Platform Play quadrant. It is a domain- and data-agnostic tool that does not require tool displacement, and it has broad use case applicability. BigPanda prioritizes stability and continuity over breakneck advancement. It has a higher aggregate score in our decision criteria, making it a Leader in this report.
### BMC: Helix IT Operations Management Suite (BMC Helix ITOM)
**Solution Overview**BMC Helix IT Operations Management Suite is an integrated AIOps and observability solution with ML/AI-powered discovery, monitoring, optimization, automation, and native remediation capabilities. BMC Helix ITOM Suite offers embedded causal, predictive, and GenAI. In addition to AIOps, the built-in observability tooling enables the direct generation of metrics, events, traces, topology, and log data, and the solution also has an open framework for ingesting metrics, events, topology, and logs from other sources and storing them in the platform data lake.
BMC Helix ITOM offers continuous discovery for infrastructure assets. Many integrations use preconfigured connectors and automated data reconciliation from third-party monitoring and ITSM tools. Its LLM is trained on customer data, and there are domain-specific and tenant-specific models that can use customer metadata.

BMC Helix ITOM is deployable as a data-agnostic tool, ingesting metrics, events, logs, traces, and alerts from other systems and natively as well. It can also serve as a data-centric solution, with particular strength in its AI implementation and native remediation engine.

**Strengths**BMC Helix ITOM scored high on most of our decision criteria. Notably, it scored a 5/5 in advanced analytics, with strong capabilities demonstrated in root cause and predictive analytics and the ability to support multidimensional analysis.
The solution also scored a 5/5 in automated remediation functionality with policy-based automation and actionable remediation driven by AL/ML algorithms, and an AI/ML-driven feedback loop for improving existing automation or implementing additional automation capabilities.

The platform scored a 4/5 for anomaly detection, providing both advanced anomaly detection (univariate) and multivariate anomaly detection, capabilities that can strongly mitigate the issues of setting thresholds in unique and complex IT environments.

BMC uses AI to generate automated causality—cause-and-effect relationships—which can lead to insights before an anomaly is detected.

Business criteria with better-than-average ratings include deployment ease, ease of use, flexibility, and vendor ecosystem.

Startup and administration information is easily available. Day-to-day usage capabilities include low-code customization of most features and a good workflow manager. Together, they give BMC Helix ITOM a better-than-average ease of use rating.

Flexibility is strong due to the ability to configure the system in a manner that best suits the enterprise. Additionally, integration with third-party data is handled well with preconfigured integrations and a low-code interface for adding additional sources.

BMC has an excellent ecosystem with training, documentation, partners, community, certifications, and professional services.

**Challenges**BMC Helix ITOM does not support SIEM or SOAR, though it can integrate data from either. Therefore, it also scores poorly on predictive security posture management. In addition, BMC does not have a direct method to see ghost changes. Changes to infrastructure and topology can be seen, but configuration and parameter changes cannot. And while the company has the standard alphabet of compliance certifications, it can’t send alerts on compliance violations.
**Purchase Considerations**The BMC Helix ITOM suite is available as a SaaS solution and as a self-managed on-premises deployment running on containers. Both use the same agent technology: BMC Helix Monitor Agent, a preconfigured containerized collector, and both deployments have feature parity. SasS support includes many regions: U.S. FedRAMP/DoD, Americas, Canada, Europe, Asia, UK, South Africa, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia.
BMC Helix ITOM can also use BMC’s observability tooling and work as a data-centric solution, allowing customers to displace or allow existing tools to feed the solution. Note that existing tools may not expose all assets, while BMC products may consume more resources but provide better analytics and automation capabilities.

The solution’s cost model is asset-based, which impacts the choices when it is being deployed due to dependencies on the assets that will be under management of the platform.

BMC HelixGPT can analyze past incidents and recommend the most likely resolution steps, as well as summarization and explainability, using HelixGPT for clusters of events.

BMC Helix ITOM is a general-purpose AIOps solution and its primary use cases center around IT operations. However, additional functionality is built on the platform’s generative AI foundation, and its strong AI capabilities allow AI-assisted troubleshooting, remediation, continuous integration, and discovery.

**Radar Chart Overview**BMC is positioned in the Maturity/Platform Play quadrant. It is an Outperformer due to its rapid rate of development related to our assessed features over the last 12 months, with a strong roadmap for the next 12 to 18 months. It is a domain/data-agnostic general-purpose AIOps solution. BMC prioritizes stability and continuity over breakneck advancement; it offers broad functionality and use case support. It has a higher aggregate score in our decision criteria, making it a Leader in this report.
### Broadcom: DX Operational Intelligence
**Solution Overview**DX Operational Intelligence is an integrated AIOps and observability platform offering full-stack application monitoring in a Broadcom-hosted SaaS application. The solution can also be deployed in any public cloud using a HELM-chart-based deployment. A self-managed solution is deployed using a containerized architecture like OpenShift or Kubernetes. DX Operational Intelligence supports intelligent automation through manual and policy-based automation triggers. It also recommends using Automic Automation workflows, which are based on heuristic analysis. Broadcom leverages existing monitoring and provides its own, allowing a transition from an existing solution to a full Broadcom solution over time. Thus, tool displacement can be gradual, or Broadcom can replace all observability tools outright. Scalable out-of-the-box connectors and the third-party integration framework (RESTMon) normalize the ingested data.
Unified dashboarding and reporting dedicated to business and IT personas and technologies leverage entire datasets across all data types. The configurable dashboards integrate analytics from the AIOps data lake comprising performance metrics, topology/relationships, logs, traces, alarms, and events.

Broadcom has particular strength in automation, and as a data-centric platform player tool displacement is not mandatory and migration to the Broadcom solution can be done gradually.

**Strengths**DX Operational Intelligence has several strong features. The solution includes advanced analytics with machine learning algorithms and data pipelines. The data pipelines are optimized for near real-time analysis of alarm correlation and root cause analysis using topology, anomaly detection, predictive capacity analytics, and automation recommendations.
Anomaly detection is available out of the box. The solution supports seasonality in the data and predicts normal behavior for the next eight hours. Anomaly alarms can be used for automated workflow actions like notifications, ticketing, and automation.

Broadcom excels in automation, including device attribute-based policies that can be defined to trigger automated alarm actions like assign, clear/close, escalate via email/ticket, hide/unhide, an automation workflow to collect additional triage information, or a remediation automation workflow.

Communications and workflow are better than most. Broadcom provides seamless integration with ITSM solutions, notifications tools, DevOps tools, and collaboration platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom. Automated workflows are supported for ticketing, notifications, and alarm actions.

Broadcom stands out in ease of deployment, usage, and solution flexibility. Installation can be almost anywhere (Broadcom cloud, public cloud, or on-premises) and managed by Broadcom or the enterprise. Data collection requires a simple agent (collector) deployment. Integrations are plentiful and often preconfigured.

**Challenges**Broadcom has one feature challenge—no support for SIEM or SOAR. SIEM and SOAR-specific capabilities—to view security logs in the context of a problem, define and save searches, alarm notifications, and metrics— are supported through logs for triage capabilities.
GenAI is currently lacking but is listed on the roadmap for 2024. Change detection is limited to change management and other process-related revisions. Changes to infrastructure and topology can be seen, but configuration and code changes cannot.

**Purchase Considerations**Costs and licensing are typical for AIOps solutions. The solution is offered with subscription licenses and usage-based pricing. Both models establish a baseline number of licenses forecasted to be consumed based on the sizing of the environment.
Broadcom offers admins tools to contain costs. These include license calculations and usage reports. The reports also show the baseline license versus actual used license count validations.

Deployment is SaaS, managed by Broadcom, and the solution is also deployable as a self-managed system on other public clouds or on-premises. Training and support are very good as part of the Broadcom support ecosystem.

Broadcom’s AIOps solution is targeted at organizations of any size, and it’s a good all-around AIOps platform. It is especially suitable for use cases where strong automation and workflow are important.

**Radar Chart Overview**Broadcom is positioned in the Maturity/Platform Play quadrant. It is a data-centric, general purpose solution. Broadcom prioritizes stability and continuity over breakneck advancement. It offers broad functionality and use case support. It has a higher aggregate score in our decision criteria, making it a Leader in this report.
### Centerity: AIOps
**Solution Overview**Centerity CSM² specializes in collecting and analyzing data from large and complex distributed edge environments, followed by extensive auto-remediation capabilities, asset management, and an exclusive real-time business service dashboard. The solution displaces existing edge monitoring and observability tools but can ingest data from other sources for a complete AIOps solution.
**Strengths**Centerity CSM² has strengths in edge AI, and in correlation and causality analysis, thanks to the edge computing architecture used by Centerity. Edge devices may have multiple monitoring points, and the ability to correlate these is a plus for Centerity.
Causality analysis in edge environments, such as retail, can be tricky as the edge stack typically holds many devices and layers of technology. Such environments can make it difficult to determine cause and effect or the root cause of an incident. Centerity does well handling this difficult situation, with the ability to auto-remediate most incidents with no human intervention.

Complex edge environments are the key focus of the Centerity offering. Though this impacts deployment ease, no other vendor concentrates on AIOps at the edge. Centerity is often used by integrators in retail, hospitality, and healthcare, where the number of devices at the edge can be substantial. The solution is easy to use, with good visualization and customization of dashboards. Flexibility is strong, which is expected for an edge-focused solution where the deployment environment is often complex and geographically dispersed.

**Challenges**Centerity can ingest data from multiple sources but does not have a native SIEM or SOAR component. It does support many security devices and can integrate with SIEM and SOAR systems.
Outside of Edge AI, Centerity support for the emerging features we assessed was limited or absent. While it does not provide automated causal inference, it does provide capabilities that support the identification of root causes of issue through anomaly detection and event management automation. Similarly, predictive security posture is an emerging feature that is not yet provided. Both features are important in edge environments where the public can access physical devices.

Changes to infrastructure and topology can be seen, but configuration and code changes cannot, leading to a lower score for the ghost change criterion. Available information does not indicate the ability to observe configuration of edge devices (IoT or otherwise). When Centerity adds this feature it will significantly improve the product. Management of compliance policies is limited to view logs and audit files.

The support ecosystem lacks easily available documentation that allows users to investigate the solution’s suitability without engaging sales or professional services. The same is true for the licensing model; no information is publicly available.

**Purchase Considerations**The configuration and deployment of an edge AIOps solution is not trivial; however, Centerity and its global partners provide professional services to support deployment. Training is available as part of deployment options, as are on-going workshops and round tables.
The platform can be delivered as an on-premises, cloud, or hybrid deployment. Licensing model information is unavailable; however, it is likely to use both device and consumption-based cost models, as is common for AIOps solutions.

Use cases for Centerity CSM² include retail and hospitality, financial services, healthcare, public safety, defense, manufacturing, and energy and utilities. These are situations where multiple devices are deployed at the edge for consumption by the public or the enterprise. The company is unique in its support of edge AI and the use cases related to pushing compute platforms and AI/ML to the edge.

**Radar Chart Overview**Centerity is positioned in the Innovation/Feature Play quadrant as it’s focused on specific functionality and use cases. The vendor is flexible and responsive to the market, and it’s likely that the solution will look and feel different year over year. It has a lower aggregate score in our decision criteria, making it an Entrant in this report.
### CloudFabrix: cfxCloud Data-Centric AIOps Platform

It is a single integrated platform that supports three deployment modes: self-managed on-premises, public or private cloud, and CloudFabrix-managed SaaS. CloudFabrix is known for its Robotic Data Automation Fabric (RDAF). The RDAF DataOps Solution Pack automates repetitive data preparation and integration activities, including metadata discovery, data quality analysis, data ingestion, data filtering/cleaning/transformation, data shaping/aggregation, data encryption/decryption, and data tracing.
CloudFabrix includes the ability to build utility AIOps/observability services that run alongside the core platform. The platform manages all observability data, routing it to a low-cost observability lake, log stores, and metrics stores for out-of-the-box integrated services. The solution also provides a data lake for persisting all the observability data within the platform. Data can also be forwarded to CloudFabrix’s composable dashboards. The solution facilitates AIOps, asset intelligence (FinOps), and log intelligence with support for vertical solutions in telecommunications, service assurance, and SAP observability. CloudFabrix offers a data fabric for GenAI, providing AutoML automation data enrichment and contextualization, conversational queries, AI dashboards, and AI for intent-driven automation.

Low-code bots from RDAF are prebuilt for certain use cases, making it unnecessary to add or maintain any code in the field. The bots can be assembled in a pipeline to deliver use-case-specific logic. The solution can integrate and ingest any observation and operational data types, including ITSM, OpenTelemetry, GNMI, SNMP traps, and MELT, and it can build entity models represented with a graph database.

### Dell Technologies: Dell APEX AIOps
**Solution Overview**Dell’s data-centric APEX AIOps solution uses multiple AI/ML techniques to rapidly process and correlate events and telemetry across the enterprise to identify and remediate service issues. Dell APEX AIOps consists of three products: Dell APEX AIOps Incident Management (formerly the Moogsoft platform); Dell APEX AIOps Infrastructure Observability (formerly the CloudIQ product, which proactively monitors and measures the overall health of Dell infrastructure through intelligent, comprehensive, and predictive analytics); and Dell APEX AIOps Application Observability (in a partnership with IBM for the Instana product). Dell APEX AIOps can be deployed as a virtual appliance using a VM Image agent, a public cloud image on AWS, a software-only self-managed solution with an optional software collector (Linux or Windows) on-premises, and a SaaS application. The solution is targeted broadly at any enterprise or service provider. Dell Incident Management on-premises solutions continue to be supported and will stay vendor agnostic. Infrastructure Observability (formerly CloudIQ) is Dell specific.
**Strengths**Dell scored a 4/5 on advanced analytics, which leverages the strong capabilities gained through the acquisition of Moogsoft and builds on the AI/ML strengths of previous incarnations of the data-agnostic solution. Dell’s offering includes data-centric observability from APEX AIOps Application Observability and Dell’s cloud management software APEX AIOps Infrastructure Observability, which also includes capacity and anomaly detection, and issue prediction capabilities. and strengths in advanced analytics and anomaly detection from Moogsoft.
Dell scored a 4/5 on SIEM and SOAR integration with the ability to ingest data from SIEM applications and integrate fully with SOAR solutions. APEX AIOps can proactively scan for the most significant cybersecurity risks per each Dell infrastructure product, as identified by the security subject matter experts from each Dell product team. They leverage AI/ML to match known Dell Security Advisories (DSAs) to customers’ infrastructure to understand which DSAs apply to the products in any given customer’s environment.

Entropy and vertex entropy, part of the advanced analytics and anomaly detection algorithms, are recalculated as the underlying data changes. No user intervention is required. The probable root cause results are a semi-supervised ML neural network that can be operator-reinforced.

For capacity predictions, a seasonality algorithm provides insights about capacity status starting 90 days after implementation. For performance forecasting, the common forecasting service predicts when KPIs are expected to reach 100%.

APEX AIOps has native support for time-series data and uses an “adaptive” algorithm to determine normal behavior baselines and detect anomalies. Events derived from metrics are correlated with other asynchronous events.

The Similar Situations function offers predictive capability, which becomes more accurate as an incident evolves. Situation Rooms, a Moogsoft signature feature, continues to enable major incident management.

Once set up and running, the solution is easy to use, with a consistent interface customizable for specific actors or teams. Using Situation Rooms and integrating the collaboration tools APEX supports provides ease of use, particularly during major incidents.

**Challenges**Dell scored a 3/5 on correlation and causality analysis, and while the solution possesses strong root-cause analysis as part of APEX AIOps, it is unable to automate cause-and-effect determinations. Probable root cause provides and builds an operator-trained model for causality in the absence of existing models.
Dell does not directly support the detection of ghost changes in software and hardware outside of established change processes. Changes to infrastructure and topology can be seen, but configuration and code change visibility is limited. By customizing the solution, support for identifying changes at the file level can be provided, but no support for parameter or code changes is available.

The solutions conform to SOC 2, GDPR, and Cloud Security Alliance STAR level one, but no support exists for managing and alerting compliance violations.

Ghost change detection may be possible using workflows, but there is little indication of interaction with the change process other than ITSM integration. There are no compliance management features available. Audit logs can be used to create reports but are not defined by default.

**Purchase Considerations**Riverbed is primarily focused on meeting the needs of the large enterprises, although it does service SMBs via its partner network. Based on its capabilities and complex feature set, Riverbed IQ may require professional services to design a complete solution. Training is readily available, and online documentation is complete if it is difficult to follow. Riverbed Edge collectors are the only on-premises software for deployment. Riverbed IQ is a subscription SaaS offering, with pricing based on volume-based consumption of tiers of runbooks per month (25,000, 50,000, and so on).
Riverbed is well-known for its expertise in network monitoring and observability. Complex networking environments can take advantage of its networking capabilities and gather other monitoring and observation data to create a viable AIOps solution.

**Radar Chart Overview**Riverbed IQ is positioned in the Maturity/Feature Play quadrant. It is classified as an Outperformer, with software updates pushed to production often daily, and most feature enhancements available at the end of two-week sprint cycles. This rapid feature-release schedule should help the company become well-established in the AIOps market. It has an average aggregate score in our decision criteria, making it a Challenger in this report.
### ScienceLogic: SL1
**Solution Overview**ScienceLogic SL1 is a scalable modular platform deployed and self-managed on-premises (using virtual machines or bare metal) or as a SaaS in AWS or Azure regions worldwide. Automations are a key feature of SL1. Runbook automation allows SL1 to execute actions automatically when specific event conditions are met. Automation in SL1 is handled by two kinds of policies: automation policies that define the event conditions that can trigger an automatic action and action policies that can be triggered when certain criteria are met.
SL1 offers a number of add-ons. Restorepoint is a disaster recovery and secure configuration management appliance for network devices, such as routers, switches, proxies, and firewalls. SL1 PowerFlow provides a generic platform for integrations between SL1 and third-party applications, such as ServiceNow, xMatters, Opsgenie, or Cherwell Service Management. Zebrium Root Cause as a Service (RCaaS) uses unsupervised machine learning on logs to automatically find the root cause of software problems. It does not require manual rules or training. As Zebrium ingests logs, its AI/ML engine analyzes the logs, looking for abnormal log line clusters that resemble problems, such as abnormally correlated rare and error events across all log streams.

**Strengths**SL1’s native orchestration and automation services approach the depth and breadth of a SOAP platform. The solution can combine runbooks with its own PowerFlow platform to enhance automation tasks. SL1 PowerFlow can handle complex automation with bidirectional and man-in-the-middle logic. However, the lack of closed-loop learning for automation keeps it from achieving the highest possible score in this category.
SL1 collaboration tools include Teams, Slack, and others. The number of OOTB-configured integrations is better than average, and collaboration tools can trigger workflows. Metrics can automatically trigger workflows within the workflow engine for autonomous issue remediation.

Overall, the solution is easy to use. Runbooks and PowerFlow automation are easy to create and maintain. The orchestration and automation features use low code—essentially no code—for creating and running automation. ScienceLogic handles SaaS upgrades, although the user is responsible for upgrading collectors and agents. Collectors are upgraded via download, while the agent upgrade is a redeploy and takes advantage of the automated bulk deployment process.

The number of deployment options and the orchestration and automation capabilities make SL1 highly flexible. The solution can be installed almost anywhere, whether self-managed or managed by ScienceLogic. However, the downside of that flexibility may be the need for professional services in complex environments.

ScienceLogic has a complete ecosystem to support partners, enterprises, and users with documentation, certifications, community, blogs, and professional services.

**Challenges**ScienceLogic does not support edge AI, but it can collect telemetry from edge devices and apply AI/ML within the SaaS application. Automated causal inference is available for log data but not with other ingestions. There is no method to detect changes made outside of change management processes, but integration with ITSM changes is possible.
**Purchase Considerations**ScienceLogic SL1 straddles the line between data-agnostic AIOps and data-centric AIOps. It provides monitoring and observability tooling, though the tooling is not required. Using PowerFlow, data and events can be ingested from anywhere. There is no requirement for professional services, although planning and implementation services are available.
Deployment options abound. The solution can be deployed on a physical or virtual appliance, to the public cloud, as software only (hardware requirements exist), SaaS, or self-managed.

SL1 is licensed via a tiered SKU model—Base, Standard, Advanced, and Premium—which offers escalating functionality. Within each tier, licensing is done per device and available via perpetual or subscription licensing.

ScienceLogic SL1 has a strong presence in managed service organizations due to its agent and agentless technologies and tenant segregation policies. Otherwise, it is a general-purpose tool suited for larger environments. Midsize companies may find the solution overwhelming, but the professional services and partnership teams are strong.

**Radar Chart Overview**ScienceLogic is positioned in the Maturity/Feature Play quadrant. It has a strong presence in managed services but doesn’t target MSPs exclusively and so is on the Feature Play side but close to the Platform Play axis. The vendor prioritizes stability and continuity over breakneck advancement. It has an average aggregate score in our decision criteria, making it a Challenger in this report.

### Splunk, a Cisco Company: Splunk Platform and Splunk Observability Cloud
**Solution Overview**Splunk’s AIOps solution spans a combination of two integrated products–Splunk Platform and Splunk Observability Cloud. Cisco acquired Splunk in March 2024, and Splunk is currently operating as a division of Cisco. The Splunk Platform includes Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud and features the premium apps Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) and Splunk Enterprise Security. It provides comprehensive log analytics and management, centralized event correlation for alert noise reduction, anomaly detection, predictive analytics, high-level business service monitoring, and automation to achieve AIOps.
Splunk Observability Cloud is an integrated product that uses any log data available on the Splunk Platform, together with metrics and trace data. It provides ITOps and engineering teams with capabilities such as application performance monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, network monitoring, real user monitoring, synthetic monitoring, point-and-click log analysis, and incident response. These capabilities can also be purchased in an a la carte fashion.

The Splunk Platform can be consumed through a SaaS model in Splunk Cloud or an on-premises deployment in Splunk Enterprise. Splunk Observability Cloud is available only through a SaaS model. This is a platform play with tool displacement required for full capability.

**Strengths**The Splunk Platform excels in advanced analytics, anomaly detection, correlation and causality analysis, and automated remediation. Its AutoML capabilities dynamically identify thresholding parameters for metrics or KPIs, provide explanations, and adapt models as the IT environment evolves. The Configuration Assistant and forthcoming Drift Detection will help manage thresholding models and detect operational changes. Splunk’s Smart Mode groups notable events using ML, and the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) offers a low-code experience with hundreds of ML algorithms and the ability to upload pretrained models.
Splunk ITSI aggregates and correlates data from diverse IT sources to visualize interdependencies and train predictive models for identifying causal links between IT events and outcomes. It automates IT and security tasks with trigger-based remediation and integrates with tools like Splunk SOAR, Ansible, and Puppet for comprehensive automation. Chatbot integration with Slack and Teams enhances collaboration.

Emerging technologies where Splunk excels include edge AI, automated causal inference, and business intelligence. The Splunk App for Data Science and Deep Learning provides forecasting, clustering, NLP, and causal inference techniques.

Splunk ITSI integrates business and technical data, offering executive-level real-time views and operational dashboards for regulatory reporting. The platform supports on-site and SaaS deployments. The robust Splunk ecosystem includes extensive documentation, community support, partnership programs, training, and professional services.

**Challenges**While Splunk has robust change detection capabilities we do not see where those changes are reconciled against change management integration to know if they are intentional and approved, or if they are ghost changes. Integration with ITSM changes is possible. Splunk does have observability, so topology changes are also visible. Also, the Splunk security products may be able to see some changes with the right tool configuration.
Splunk allows for the creation of compliance management visibility within the platform, but it is not offered as a standalone console within the Splunk Platform. Audit logs do allow the creation of compliance reports, but there are no alerts on compliance violations.

**Purchase Considerations**Following the March 2024 acquisition, Splunk is currently operating as a division of Cisco. In June, at Cisco Live, Cisco announced its full-stack observability vision for Cisco and Splunk customers which included that it is no longer selling the Cisco observability solution for cloud-native APM to net-new customers and is replacing it directly with Splunk Observability Cloud. As part of that strategy, Cisco is merging AppDynamics into Splunk.
The Splunk Platform, both the on-premises and SaaS versions, may require some professional services support for complex enterprises. However, smaller companies may find the training and documentation sufficient. The Splunk Platform is used on-premises, while Splunk Observability Cloud is SaaS. The Splunk Platform is supported by physical and virtual machines on-premises or in the cloud. Self-management is an option in any deployment scenario.

Splunk targets organizations of any size. Given its history in log management, it should be considered a strong option for organizations with a significant log volume.

**Radar Chart Position**Splunk is a Leader in the Maturity/Platform Play quadrant. The company has demonstrated strong delivery over the last year with an update cadence of six minor monthly and six weekly patch releases, and this looks set to continue, classifying Splunk as an Outperformer. Splunk prioritizes stability and continuity over breakneck advancement and offers broad functionality and use case support. It has a higher aggregate score in our decision criteria, making it a Leader in this report.
### Sumo Logic
**Solution Overview**Sumo Logic is a cloud-native, multitenant SaaS solution hosted on AWS and available in multiple regions. The AIOps solution comprises three products: Troubleshooting and Monitoring, Cloud Infrastructure Security, and Cloud SIEM. Cloud SOAR can be added. This report focuses only on the Enterprise Suite offering. Lower tiers do not include sufficient features for an enterprise AIOps solution. Sumo Logic provides a monitoring and observability solution that displaces existing tools in these areas.
There is an OpenTelemetry collector for data aggregation of all logs, metrics, traces, and events. Sumo Logic can collect data from many cloud and on-premises technologies, using OpenTelemetry, Fluentd, and agentless technologies.

**Strengths**SIEM and SOAR can be activated as part of the enterprise licensing tier, subject to minimum volume and service requirements.
Sumo Logic offers Cloud SIEM, with Insight Rules Engine (including 900+ out-of-the-box rules), Entity Timeline, Entity Relationship Graph, Insight Global Confidence Scores, Automation Service (playbooks for Insight enrichment, notifications, and containment actions), and MITRE ATT&CK Coverage Explorer. Cloud SOAR has Playbooks (including a complete Sumo Logic playbook catalog), Progressive Automation, Case Manager, Supervised Active Intelligence, and War Room features.

Deployment is via a multitenant, multiregion SaaS offering. Collectors are available for Kubernetes, AWS Observability, tracing, and custom or app component metrics (using Telegraf). Sumo Logic manages all of them. Ease of use is better than average, with drag-and-drop workflows and easy customization using low-code methods. The Sumo Logic ecosystem includes documentation, training, certification, community, partners, and professional services.

Sumo Logic uses prebuilt apps or custom queries for audit and compliance. It supports both internal audits, which are conducted by members of the organization, and external audits, where a government or other independent authority checks data to verify compliance standards. Both internal and external audits can be scheduled or random, and can be included in Sumo Logic’s queries, alerts, and dashboards to monitor data and ensure only authorized users have access to sensitive information.

**Challenges**Sumo Logic can ingest data from edge devices, but the use of AI at the edge is not available. However, Sumo Logic does offer Sensu, an open-core project that enables observability as code. Sensu can filter telemetry at the edge using proprietary pipelines to enact use cases such as alert noise reduction.
Sumo Logic does not yet provide direct support for automated causal inference. However, its roadmap includes additional capabilities to understand cause-effect relationships, including event analytics, which directly correlate application/infrastructure telemetry with user- and system-induced changes.

The Sumo Logic Alert Response experience allows first responders (on-call engineers, SOC analytics, security engineers) to view the details of an alert as well as prebuilt cause-effect analytics, called “Alert Context.” Its security offerings for SIEM and SOAR do not have predictive security posture management. It is possible to integrate with third-party solutions.

Changes made outside of change management processes cannot be detected. However, with proper configurations, the Sumo Logic security products may be able to see some types of changes.

**Purchase Considerations**Sumo Logic has added AI to its observability tools without calling the result an AIOps solution. This may be a marketing oversight or a specific direction for Sumo Logic. The available professional services are not required to deploy and operate Sumo Logic.
In March 2024, Sumo Logic launched a new Flex pricing model available for new customers. Like the previous model, this one is also credit-based; however, there are significant changes, including zero-dollar ingest pricing—credits are now consumed by scanning data (i.e., generating analytics), and there is a nominal storage fee. Data tiering complexity has been removed and all data is instantaneously available at maximum performance. This model simplified the credit-to-dollar ratio—one credit = $1 (MSRP); and consolidated licensing to a single plan with all available capabilities—Enterprise Suite Flex (though Cloud SIEM and Cloud SOAR require separate activation).

Current customers can leverage the old pricing model from previous years. Credits are consumed for multiple variables, including the data type (such as logs, metrics, and traces) and the destined data tier (Continuous, Frequent, or Infrequent).

Sumo Logic markets to organizations of any size. Typical use cases include DevOps, SecOps (SIEM and SOAR), and business analytics. As a general-purpose solution, Sumo Logic does not target specific industries or vertical markets.

**Radar Chart Overview**Sumo Logic is positioned in the Maturity/Platform Play quadrant. It provides broad functionality and use case support but does require tool displacement. The vendor is responsive to market needs and is investing in emerging features, and so is positioned close to the Innovation axis. It has an average aggregate score in our decision criteria, making it a Challenger in this report.

Zenoss has event correlation and root cause analysis, which are forms of causal inference, but it does not support automatic cause-and-effect determination. Zenoss has some integrations with SIEM and SOAR tools although it lacks some of the more advanced automations, workflow triggers, and RBAC passed notifications. There is no support for detecting changes outside established DevOps or ITSM change management. Zenoss provides compliance monitoring and can alert users to non-compliance issues with topology objects.
**Purchase Considerations**Zenoss incorporates third-party solutions to provide a comprehensive view of the IT environment. Training programs and certifications are available. The user community offers collaboration and knowledge-sharing tools, but its activity level is moderate. Zenoss provides professional deployment, customization, and optimization services.
Zenoss provides a powerful and flexible AIOps solution suitable for diverse IT environments, with notable data handling, analytics, and integration strengths. The SaaS deployment option is quick to enable, while the on-premises version provides self-service capabilities.

Zenoss uses a subscription-based licensing model for its SaaS platform and traditional device-based licensing for on-premises deployments. The cost structure is competitive but can be higher than some alternatives, especially for large-scale implementations.

Zenoss is a general-purpose AIOps solution, though it has a strong presence in federal, financial, and healthcare environments, and with service providers.

**Radar Chart Overview**Zenoss is positioned in the Maturity/Platform Play quadrant. Zenoss’s feature release rate is somewhat slower than the market. Releases for Service Dynamics appear only yearly although the SaaS solution, Zenoss Cloud, is updated more often, leading to an overall classification of Forward Mover on our Radar. It has an average aggregate score in our decision criteria, making it a Challenger in this report.
### ZIF: AIOps

### 6. Analyst’s Outlook
In the evolving landscape of AIOps, the integration of GenAI and LLMs is becoming commonplace among vendors. However, the outcomes vary widely due to the lack of standardized implementation methods. Most vendors have at least incorporated chatbots to facilitate interaction with their data sets. Some have enhanced their anomaly detection methods and closed-loop remediation processes for continuous learning, while a few allow chatbots to create visualizations without requiring knowledge of the underlying data.

A notable trend is the rebranding of observability solutions as AIOps by adding minimal AI capabilities. The journey from monitoring to observability and intelligence varies significantly across vendors. True intelligence is not a simple add-on feature; it requires a comprehensive understanding of business and IT operations. Solutions that best integrate business data with IT intelligence will offer the most value.

One critical area where AIOps solutions are making strides is in detecting ghost changes—unauthorized modifications that often lead to incidents. While GenAI holds promise, only a single vendor, Evolven, can detect ghost changes down to the parameter level. This feature benefits large, complex environments where such changes can cause significant disruptions.

The debate between data-agnostic and data-centric AIOps approaches continues to shape deployment strategies. A single-vendor solution covering the entire monitoring-to-intelligence chain can streamline operations and reduce costs. However, for larger organizations, integrating AIOps with existing tools is crucial. Displacing incumbent solutions requires navigating political landscapes and achieving consensus among stakeholders with differing priorities.

DevOps teams aim to expedite code deployment, while ITOps focuses on maintaining system stability. Infrastructure administrators, already equipped with monitoring tools, may resist additional solutions. Consequently, AIOps initiatives often require support from C-level executives who prioritize strategic organization-wide benefits over tactical gains.

A data-agnostic approach allows AIOps solutions to ingest data from any source, often sidestepping the need for immediate consensus. This method can gradually build a comprehensive enterprise view by incorporating data feeds over time. Although it requires ongoing effort, the initial implementation is less disruptive. In contrast, data-centric solutions may quickly replace existing tools, causing short-term upheaval but potentially offering faster integration.

Selecting an AIOps solution hinges on an organization’s specific needs and strategic goals. A thorough review of each vendor’s key features, emerging technologies, and business criteria will guide the decision-making process. Whether opting for a data-agnostic or data-centric approach, the ultimate goal is to enhance operational intelligence and drive meaningful improvements in IT and business performance.
