The incident commander role carries a high cognitive load. Tactical coordination happens across distributed teams, often through manual, toil-heavy processes. Maintaining situational awareness means manually aggregating data from multiple tools, assigning tasks, chasing updates and translating between systems, all while downtime and customer impact grow.

[AI agents](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-a-comprehensive-introduction-for-developers/) can take on that operational layer. The incident commander becomes less of a micromanager and more of a strategist, offloading context gathering and synthesis to focus on the most high-stakes decisions: which subject matter experts to mobilize, which response strategy to follow and what improvements to prioritize post-resolution. However, this requires determining the best times in which AI agents should be deployed and how they should [work side by side with humans](https://thenewstack.io/human-on-the-loop-the-new-ai-control-model-that-actually-works/).

Here are four scenarios where AI agents can actively redefine the incident commander role across the incident life cycle.

### **1. Triage: From Coordination Overhead to Strategic Direction**

**Before Agents**

The incident commander’s first challenge is organizational. Who needs to be pulled into the response team? What context do they need?

While responders wait for direction, the incident commander may struggle to correlate information from multiple sources, deciding which experts to mobilize while trying to form a coherent hypothesis to guide the response. Every minute spent on this discovery phase adds to the impact on customers and the business.

**After Agents**

A specialized AI agent can get the incident commander three steps ahead of an incident, effectively bypassing the need to orchestrate data gathering across teams and tools. The agent can quickly deliver an intelligence brief, including:

* Probable root cause
* Supporting evidence (correlated signals, similar past incidents, recent changes)
* Recommended response strategy and relevant runbooks

The incident commander can immediately evaluate the hypothesis, refine the response strategy and mobilize the right people with the right context. The human cognitive load shifts from “What do we know?” to “What’s our best path forward?” — allowing the incident commander to lead strategically while the agent handles investigative groundwork.

### **2. Communication: From Status Chasing To Real-Time Updates**

**Before Agents**

Status updates are essential, but time-consuming. On average, every 30 minutes during a critical incident, a team member (often the incident commander or a dedicated communications lead) scrambles to [collect scattered information](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-streamline-communication-during-incidents/) and draft an update. If cadence slips, gaps appear and stakeholder trust erodes, both within the business and with customers. And when stakeholders don’t get the answers they expect, they begin reaching out directly to the [incident response team](https://thenewstack.io/what-can-incident-teams-learn-from-crisis-management/), taking away valuable resources from problem-solving.

**After Agents**

AI agents can automatically transcribe incident calls, generate structured incident summaries and draft persona-specific updates, including key data around:

* Current incident status
* Customer impact
* Key decisions and actions taken so far
* Recommended next steps

The incident commander checks accuracy, fine-tunes tone and level of detail and sends the update. Everyone is timely kept in the loop without having to steal cycles from response work, and, as newcomers enter the incident, AI can catch them up on what’s been happening without requiring someone to take time out to debrief on the situation.

### **3. Remediation: From Manual Execution To Automated Fixes**

**Before Agents**

Once the root cause is identified, responder teams need to take action. However, runbooks can often be outdated, incomplete or worse: nonexistent. Executing the fix requires taking manual steps under pressure to restore service quickly. The incident commander oversees this with limited visibility, meaning approvals can happen through side channels with minimal context, and there’s rarely time to document what worked for next time.

**After Agents**

The path to remediation can be made clearer, as AI agents can proactively suggest the best actions to take while teams maintain security controls and human oversight. At this stage, an AI agent can:

* Recommend a fix based on past remediation paths.
* Immediately surface relevant runbooks to follow.
* Execute remediation with human approval and confirm when the service is restored.
* Generate a playbook to help prevent similar issues in the future.

The incident commander’s role shifts from coordinating [manual execution to governing automated resolution](https://thenewstack.io/move-away-from-manual-with-automated-incident-response/). High-risk changes require explicit approval, but low-risk, well-tested remediations can run autonomously with audit logging. Every action is traceable, every fix is documented and institutional knowledge improves with each incident.

### **4. Learning: From Post-Incident Scramble To Actionable Insights**

**Before Agents**

The incident is resolved. Documenting what happened usually means scrolling through chat threads, pulling logs and cross-checking deploys. Decisions made in side channels or communicated verbally go missing. Instead of extracting learnings, teams spend time piecing together the “what” rather than the “why.”

**After Agents**

The AI agent assembles the incident timeline immediately after an incident, capturing data from multiple sources, including:

* Smart incident summaries based on chat history and incident call transcription.
* Insights into what triggered or contributed to the issue via monitoring logs.
* Remediation steps taken, who executed them and when from incident and chat logs.

The value of AI agents extends beyond documentation. The agent uses this enriched incident data to improve runbooks, identify automation opportunities and surface patterns that help prevent similar issues. [Time is no longer wasted](https://thenewstack.io/no-time-to-waste-8-ways-to-succeed-with-ai-agents/) reconstructing what happened, but instead devoted to identifying areas of improvement and how. The incident commander becomes a driver of actionable learning cycles that [build operational resilience](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-build-resilient-it-operations-in-4-steps/) and reduce recurring incidents.

## **The Path Forward**

As AI agents take on repeatable, routine work, incident commanders regain time for strategic, high-value decisions. Delegating has always been part of what an incident commander does when the pressure is high. The only change now is that there are more “hands” on deck to delegate to.

With AI agents, response teams and the commanders who lead them can focus on the work that needs humans and use agents as the AI assistants incident response has always needed.
