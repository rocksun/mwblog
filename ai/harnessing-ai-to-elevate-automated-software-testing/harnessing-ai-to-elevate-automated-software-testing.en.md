[Automated software testing](https://thenewstack.io/ai-testing-more-coverage-fewer-bugs-new-risks/) continues to be a key tool for driving engineering efficiency, and with the rise of AI, greater opportunities emerge to elevate testing practices to the next level. With AI, organizations can empower their engineering teams to deliver high-quality software while improving risk detection, increasing scalability and reducing maintenance burdens.

Here are three benefits organizations can gain from [incorporating AI into automated testing](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-use-generative-ai-for-software-testing-and-quality-assurance/) to modernize their operations for the long haul.

## 1. Generate Deeper Unit and Integration Tests

When engineers have AI tools available in their code editors, they no longer need to construct every possible way the features would need to be tested. Engineers can provide detailed prompts to the AI tools about how the product is designed to work, and the AI can then write all of the necessary tests. Additionally, the AI-generated tests can supply a different variety of test data where edge cases can be uncovered more frequently, enabling teams to understand even more ways in which the features can be used.

Improved testing also allows teams to achieve higher code coverage, which is the metric to measure how much of the code has been tested. With a higher code coverage, teams can go back to make changes or do maintenance more efficiently because they know the code is well tested.

## 2. Raise the Bar on Best Practices

AI makes it easier for [teams to develop testing strategies with greater depth](https://thenewstack.io/empowering-it-teams-through-seamless-ui-and-ai-agents/) and broaden the scope of their testing analysis. For example, teams can cover specific test cases and reason with the tool, such as saying, “This part of my logic isn’t covered” or “I’m worried about how fragile this part is” to try to address potential issues before they arise. This encourages teams to be more proactive in building solutions that will help minimize the risk of future disruption.

Coding and design patterns that can be repeated can also be highlighted, which teams can then use to create playbooks for standardization. As a result, teams can establish higher engineering standards and best practices to drive increased efficiency across the organization.

## 3. Ease Collaboration Between Engineers

Engineering teams may often find themselves with conflicting design or development recommendations, which may be based on their experience from previous roles at different companies. When teams struggle to come to an agreed decision, it slows down the overall development process. AI can help guide decision-making by quickly providing insights into industry standards and best practices so the team can prioritize what works best for their chosen stack, as well as determine the option that’s most sustainable for the long run.

## A Low-Risk Environment for AI Development

Because it doesn’t run in production, automated testing is a low-risk environment for AI, making it easier for teams to enhance their development without putting the overall system at risk. By incorporating AI into the software testing process, organizations can become more confident that the solutions that they’re building and integrating will be well tested, allowing their [operations to become more resilient](https://thenewstack.io/how-ai-and-automation-can-improve-operational-resiliency/) in the long term.
