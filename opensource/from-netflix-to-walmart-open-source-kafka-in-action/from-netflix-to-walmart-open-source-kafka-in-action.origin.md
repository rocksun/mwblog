From e-commerce transactions to Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data to security logs and well beyond, businesses are up against an ever-growing torrent of real-time data that is mission critical to customer experiences, operations and business efficiency. For many enterprises, [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), the open source event streaming platform, has been the answer.

Curious how you can best put Kafka to work?

This quick primer covers specific Kafka use cases, real-world proof points from some of the largest and most data-critical enterprises, and operational best practices to help you get the results you want, as quickly as possible.

## What Can Kafka Do for You?
Kafka excels in four critical enterprise scenarios: real-time data processing, messaging, operational metrics and log aggregation.

### Real-Time Data Processing
Real-time data processing is where Kafka truly shines. Think of Kafka as your enterprise’s central nervous system. The [open source technology](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-explain-the-security-advantages-of-open-source) can instantly process millions of events from multiple sources while ensuring no data is lost.

For example, an e-commerce platform can use Kafka to simultaneously [process customer clicks](https://engineering.linkedin.com/kafka/kafka-linkedin-current-and-future), inventory updates and shipping status changes, enabling real-time personalization and inventory management. Kafka’s architecture handles these [massive data streams](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-data-streaming) with minimal delay and maximum reliability, while its built-in analysis capabilities let teams extract immediate insights from their data flows.

### Messaging
Kafka’s messaging capability acts as a digital switchboard, enabling seamless real-time communication between hundreds or even thousands of applications and systems. Consider a financial services company processing credit card transactions: Kafka can simultaneously route transaction data to fraud detection systems, customer databases and analytics platforms without missing a beat.

As organizations scale and message volumes increase, Kafka scales right along with you, handling the load while ensuring no critical communications are lost.

### Operational Metrics
Operational metrics function as a control tower, with Kafka used for collecting and providing that data for monitoring real-time metrics from across your entire technology stack. Whether you’re tracking application performance, system health or business key performance indicators (KPIs), Kafka provides a single source of truth for real-time monitoring and alerting.

Global enterprises use Kafka to monitor millions of metrics per second, spotting and addressing potential issues before they impact customers. Kafka also integrates seamlessly with the most popular monitoring tools, making it easy to visualize trends and take action when needed.

### Log Aggregation
Last but not least, Kafka turns log management from a headache into a strategic asset. Instead of struggling to piece together logs from dozens or hundreds of systems, teams get a complete, real-time view of everything happening across their infrastructure.

When a security incident occurs, analysts can instantly access and analyze relevant logs from any system or time period. Large enterprises process billions of log entries through Kafka daily, using this comprehensive data for everything from threat detection to application performance optimization. Unlike traditional logging systems that buckle under heavy loads, Kafka maintains its performance even as your log volumes grow exponentially.

## How Do Real-World Enterprises Use Kafka?
Let’s look at how some of the most prominent enterprises in the world are [using Kafka](https://thenewstack.io/how-we-completed-a-massive-kafka-and-cassandra-migration).

### Netflix Masters Real-Time Personalization
With around 300 million subscribers worldwide, [Netflix processes](https://thenewstack.io/developer-productivity-engineering-at-netflix/) an astronomical amount of user data every second. Kafka serves as the [backbone of Netflix’s real-time personalization engine](https://netflixtechblog.com/kafka-inside-keystone-pipeline-dd5aeabaf6bb), instantly processing viewer behavior to deliver spot-on content recommendations. Every click, pause and playback decision feeds into Netflix’s Kafka system, enabling the company to continually refine each viewer’s experience. Any enterprise with a digital presence can apply a similar approach to transform customer data into more personalized experiences.

### Pinterest Powers Split-Second Content Discovery
Pinterest must keep its hundreds of millions of users engaged by instantly connecting them with content they’ll love. [The company uses Kafka](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-pinterest-runs-kafka-at-scale-ff9c6f735be#:~:text=Pinterest%20runs%20one%20of%20the%20largest%20Kafka%20deployments%20in%20the%20cloud.%20We%20use%20Apache%20Kafka%20extensively%20as%20a%20message%20bus%20to%20transport%20data%20and%20to%20power%20real%2Dtime%20streaming%20services%2C%20ultimately%20helping%20more%20than%20250%20million%20Pinners%20around%20the%20world%20discover%20and%20do%20what%20they%20love.) and stateful stream processing to process data streams in real time, enabling its recommendation engine to provide suggestions informed by each user’s most recent activity. Kafka’s [Streams API](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) provides this capability, supporting use cases that call for the processing of data as it arrives while also maintaining the state information of multiple data records (with the ability to leverage previous records).

### Walmart Scales Real-Time Commerce Operations
As the [largest retailer](https://nrf.com/research-insights/top-retailers/top-100-retailers/top-100-retailers-2024-list) in the United States, Walmart’s massive retail operations in the United States rely on real-time data processing to handle trillions of Kafka messages every day across its cloud infrastructure. Because it faces sudden spikes in data traffic, particularly during high-volume shopping periods like the holiday season, Walmart’s engineering team developed an innovative solution called the [Messaging Proxy Service](https://medium.com/walmartglobaltech/reliably-processing-trillions-of-kafka-messages-per-day-23494f553ef9) that fundamentally changed how they handle message processing. This smart strategy for reimaging Kafka infrastructure enabled Walmart to maintain high performance during peak periods while reducing operational costs.

## Put Kafka To Work
Processing and acting on real-time data is becoming less of an advantage and more of necessity. In my view, Kafka has proven itself as the go-to platform for enterprises that need to handle massive data streams with confidence.

Whether you’re building out a real-time analytics strategy, powering personalized experiences or modernizing your security operations, Kafka provides the foundation you need — and it’s plenty powerful in its fully open source version.

The examples from Netflix, Pinterest and Walmart show a small part of what’s possible and what some of the largest businesses are doing with the platform. With the right approach and best practices, your organization can join these leaders in harnessing the full power of your real-time data.
