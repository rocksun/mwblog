As an entrepreneur deeply immersed in the world of open source technology, I’ve witnessed a significant shift in the landscape over the past decade. The once-niche concept of building businesses on top of open source projects has evolved into a mainstream phenomenon. Investors are increasingly interested in startups that embrace the open source ethos, contributing to and differentiating themselves within these collaborative communities.
The evolution of open source adoption is evident on both the producer and consumer fronts. For producers, leveraging
[open source has become the fastest way to attract developers](https://thenewstack.io/open-source-developers-are-securitys-new-front-line/) for collaboration. Foundations like [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/?utm_content=inline-mention) and [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) have grown in influence, while permissive and copyleft licensing models like Apache 2.0 and MIT have gained wide acceptance. Additionally, mainstream projects from influential players, including major cloud providers, have [contributed to the widespread adoption of open source](https://thenewstack.io/open-source-contributions-on-the-rise-in-fintech-healthcare-and-government/).
Enterprise consumers, on the other hand, have become more accepting and trusting of open source. The lower risk associated with open source, the ability to tap into a broader talent pool and the opportunity to enhance brand perception by participating in open communities have all contributed to its increasing popularity among businesses. For many such enterprises, “open source first” has become a mandate throughout their organizations.
However, despite the value that open source brings to enterprise consumers, there is a disconnect in how much businesses are willing to pay for it compared to closed-source alternatives. In my view,
[open source software](https://thenewstack.io/what-security-means-for-open-source-software/) is often more valuable due to its lower risk and higher innovation potential, yet buyers often are hesitant to pay a premium for it.
This brings us to a crucial point: the evolution of business models in the open source space. I firmly believe that open source should be priced higher than closed source, considering the benefits it offers. However, the challenge lies in extracting this value for producers. Currently, consumers are reaping the benefits of innovation from the open source community without paying a premium.
Several companies, including HashiCorp, have grappled with this dilemma, attempting to find the balance between community strategy and commercial strategy. The distinction between these two aspects is vital; a misstep in either direction can hinder long-term success.

Reflecting on my own entrepreneurial journey, I realize the importance of developing both distribution and monetization strategies in parallel when building a business atop open source projects. Too often, entrepreneurs delay addressing the monetization aspect, leading to challenges down the road. Validating these strategies early on is crucial, ensuring the community’s growth aligns with a well-thought-out commercial plan.
In hindsight, if I could revisit 2018, at
[Tetrate](https://www.tetrate.io/?utm_content=inline-mention)’s beginning, I would advise my past self to launch aggressively and embrace the monetization aspect sooner. The life cycle of a project has distinct phases, and tapping into the earlier stages — when users need more support and don’t yet know the best practices — provides a prime opportunity to commercialize your expertise and value-added product features, and thereby extract more value.
The decision to build a commercial product based on open source, as we did, was influenced by the market dynamics of that time. However, recognizing that the literal market rewards may not align with the true value of open source, I would consider running both open distribution and enterprise/SaaS models simultaneously, albeit with a clear understanding that it requires more significant funding.
The complexities of making these decisions as a founder are real. Issues of funding, aligning investment into community and sales at the right maturity curves of the project, and the uncertain nature of the market all play a role. It’s easy to offer advice in hindsight, but these are the challenges that entrepreneurs face in real-time.
The
[open source landscape has undergone significant changes](https://thenewstack.io/fight-climate-change-with-open-source/), and entrepreneurs must navigate these shifts strategically. Embracing open source is about more than just distribution; it requires a thoughtful approach to commercial strategy. As the market continues to mature, both founders and investors need to evolve their thinking to ensure the long-term success of [open source businesses](https://thenewstack.io/ebay-betting-on-open-source-is-great-for-your-business/).
