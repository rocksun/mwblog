Open source frameworks like Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright are the first stop for most startups when they automate their end-to-end tests. This process generally happens early, [according to our research,](https://www.rainforestqa.com/state-of-test-automation-2024) with 69% of software teams with just 6-10 developers automating their testing.

But make no mistake. We recently [surveyed](https://3f88e834.streaklinks.com/CNMvUqKiouhZax-ddgBX5env/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rainforestqa.com%2Fstate-of-test-automation-2024) developers and engineering leaders from around the globe to understand how current practices impact software velocity. One thing that immediately became apparent was that open source testing frameworks are “free,” but their costs snowball once you start adding testing infrastructure, plugins, and test management software.

And those are just the costs you can track in expenses.

## Hidden Costs of Open Source Testing
There’s a more insidious [cost — your team’s valuable time](https://thenewstack.io/qa-why-observability-data-sampling-can-cost-devops-teams-time-and-money/).

The data is striking: 55% of all teams using open source testing frameworks spend at least 20 hours per week creating and maintaining tests. Anyone who’s used these frameworks knows that digging around in the code and identifying element selectors is painful, time-consuming work.

This is why open source testing is often the main bottleneck for teams aiming to ship fast and frequently.

The more complex your app becomes, the more tests — and test maintenance — are required to give you confidence in the quality of your app’s critical flows. You’re stuck hiring expensive QA engineers or having your [developers spend more time](https://thenewstack.io/why-traditional-logging-and-observability-waste-developer-time/) updating tests (instead of shipping code).

A commitment to code quality is admirable, but it’s time to ask why we’re OK making these suboptimal trade-offs.

## Embracing New Avenues
The industry shows a strong appetite for genAI — 81% of teams already use AI in their testing workflows, and trust in AI has increased significantly over the past year. Yet, surprisingly, AI hasn’t delivered meaningful time savings for teams using open source frameworks. It’s too soon to dismiss AI’s future potential impact, but it’s worth considering alternatives while AI [models and approaches mature](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-maturity-model-your-expected-business-outcomes/).

On the other hand, no-code has shown a considerable advantage over open source in saving time on test creation and maintenance. This makes sense: it’s much easier to execute sooner when you’re using an intuitive, no-code tool where anyone can quickly make changes to plain English tests without any special training.

- For mid-sized teams (11-30 developers), 42% of teams using open source spend more than 20 hours per week, while only 10% of teams using no-code tools do.
- For the largest teams (>50 developers), 75% of teams using open source spend more than 20 hours per week, compared to just 50% of no-code teams.
No-code [test automation tools help software](https://thenewstack.io/no-time-for-test-automation/) teams achieve reliable test suites sooner. 93% of small teams using no-code keep their test suites consistently updated, compared to just 75% using open source.

Reliable test suites mean fewer bugs reaching production, less time fixing things, and more time and energy for shipping net-new code.

## Headcount Planning
The data all point to a clear strategy for technical leaders: invest early in the right tooling so you can spend more effectively on headcount. Newer options mean anyone can automate testing with no code, so you don’t need to allocate your budget to specialized QA personnel.

When shipping velocity determines success, can you still afford to stick with “free” tools? Your software team’s time is worth more.
