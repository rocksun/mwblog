Open source has reshaped software development, driving innovation, enabling collaboration, and allowing teams to build faster than ever before. Yet, alongside these benefits lies an often overlooked challenge: Inefficiency in managing its components. Automated dependency management — if the [automation is reliable — offers a way](https://thenewstack.io/three-ways-automation-can-improve-workplace-culture/) to address these challenges by streamlining processes, reducing manual effort, and empowering teams to focus on innovation instead of repetitive software composition analysis (SCA) tasks.

The scope of the problem is significant. According to Sonatype’s [2024 State of the Software Supply Chain Report](https://www.sonatype.com/state-of-the-software-supply-chain/introduction), the average application includes 150 dependencies, 90% of which are transitive — dependencies indirectly pulled in through other libraries. These transitive dependencies account for 96% of known vulnerabilities, making them both critical to address and hard to track. Despite their best intentions, many development teams lack the strategies or tools to navigate these challenges effectively.

Beyond technical complexities, there’s a strategic question: how can organizations balance the demand for speed with the [need for robust security](https://thenewstack.io/security-needs-create-more-work-for-open-source-maintainers/)? With shorter [development timelines and increasingly sophisticated security](https://thenewstack.io/building-and-securing-containers-with-slim-ai/) threats, this balancing act defines the current software supply chain management landscape. The answer that tips the scale lies in not choosing one over the other but addressing inefficiencies.

**The True Impact of Inefficiency**
Open source inefficiencies impact organizations in ways that go well beyond technical concerns. First, they drain productivity. Developers spend as much as [35% of their time](https://thenewstack.io/how-much-time-do-developers-spend-actually-writing-code/) untangling dependency issues or managing vulnerabilities — time that could be far better spent building new products, paying down technical debt, or introducing automation to drive cost efficiencies.

A welcome outcome of efficient supply chain management is stronger security. Organizations naturally reduce their exposure to risks like supply chain attacks by addressing dependency inefficiencies. While these attacks surged by 156% in 2024, proactive management ensures vulnerabilities are mitigated early, turning potential risks into opportunities to build trust and resilience.

Perhaps the most intangible but equally damaging consequence is the erosion of trust. When software fails to meet expectations for security and resilience, it impacts users and the broader perception of a company’s reliability. Businesses rely on [secure supply chains](https://thenewstack.io/flaw-in-r-creates-supply-chain-security-risks/) to deliver on their promises, and inefficiencies in these systems can quickly undermine even the strongest reputations. Once trust is lost, it’s nearly impossible to win back.

**Understanding the Root Cause**
At the heart of these inefficiencies is a need for greater visibility. Direct dependencies are relatively easy to track, but transitive ones buried deep within the [software stack are harder to manage](https://thenewstack.io/managing-software-development-team-dynamics-from-within/). These unseen elements can significantly increase an organization’s attack surface, yet they often go unnoticed until it’s too late.

Outdated dependencies compound the challenge. According to the report, 80% of application dependencies remain un-upgraded for over a year. While not all of these components introduce critical vulnerabilities, failing to address them increases the risk of undetected security gaps and adds unnecessary complexity to the software supply chain. This lack of timely updates leaves development teams with [mounting technical debt](https://thenewstack.io/technical-debt-continues-to-mount-heres-how-to-solve-it/) and a higher likelihood of encountering issues that could have been avoided.

The rapid pace of software evolution adds another layer of difficulty. Dependencies can become outdated in weeks, creating a moving target that’s hard to manage without automation and actionable insights. Teams often play catch-up, deepening inefficiencies and increasing the time spent on reactive maintenance. Automation helps bridge this gap by scanning for risks and prioritizing high-impact fixes, ensuring teams focus on the areas that matter most.

Advanced tools that provide visibility and automation can mitigate these challenges. By mapping the entire dependency tree and highlighting outdated components, they provide the insights teams need to take timely, informed action, significantly improving the efficiency of vulnerability remediation efforts.

**Practical Steps to Address Open Source Waste**
Optimizing the software supply chain isn’t just about solving inefficiencies — it’s about creating a better developer experience. Automation is critical here, reducing manual effort and enabling developers to focus on creative, high-value work rather than repetitive dependency management tasks. Integrating [security and dependency management early in the development](https://thenewstack.io/3-api-vulnerabilities-developers-accidentally-create/) lifecycle, automated tools help make development faster, more enjoyable, and more rewarding.

Equally important is the adoption of context-aware tools that combine automation with prioritization. Not all vulnerabilities are created equal, and automated tools that assess risks based on exploitability, business impact, and application exposure allow teams to allocate resources effectively. This targeted approach ensures critical issues are addressed quickly, while less urgent concerns don’t distract from more pressing tasks.

Finally, improving visibility across the entire dependency tree, including transitive dependencies, is essential. Automated solutions provide actionable insights into how dependencies interact and where risks lie, enabling teams to make informed decisions about updates, replacements, or removals. This insight reduces unnecessary complexity and builds a more dependable and resilient software supply chain.

These measures aren’t about doing more work but working smarter. Organizations can reclaim lost productivity by adopting strategic, data-driven practices and leveraging automation at every stage while significantly reducing costs. Automated tools and more intelligent workflows avoid the expense of rework and minimize time spent resolving vulnerabilities, enabling teams to focus resources on delivering innovative features.

**Unlocking the Potential of Open Source**
While managing open source presents challenges, the opportunities far outweigh the risks if inefficiencies are effectively addressed. Automation is a key enabler here, helping organizations streamline dependency management and transform open source waste into a source of strength.

Reducing inefficiencies saves time and resources and reinforces trust in the software supply chain. Automated tools empower developers to dedicate their efforts to building innovative features while customers and partners benefit from more secure, dependable products. By integrating automation into every development lifecycle stage, teams can proactively manage risks while accelerating delivery timelines.

Open source has become a cornerstone of modern software development. By mitigating hidden costs and leveraging automation to enhance processes, organizations can ensure that it remains a sustainable and secure foundation for innovation that will drive progress for years.
