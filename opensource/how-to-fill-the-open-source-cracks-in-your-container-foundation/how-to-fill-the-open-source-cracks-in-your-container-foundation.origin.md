Containers fueled by open source software have become the de facto way for software development teams to package and deploy modern applications and services. Open source tools, including [Docker](https://thenewstack.io/docker-launches-hardened-images-intensifying-secure-container-market/), [Kubernetes](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes/), [Helm](https://thenewstack.io/what-the-helm-the-tool-we-all-love-and-sometimes-hate/), [Prometheus](https://thenewstack.io/prometheus-at-10-whats-been-its-impact-on-observability/), [Grafana](https://thenewstack.io/why-grafana-needs-opentelemetry/), [Argo](https://thenewstack.io/boost-shipping-velocity-with-argo-and-buildpacks/) and [OTel](https://thenewstack.io/otel-is-the-secret-to-devops-success/), provide a robust foundation for the container ecosystem.

But that foundation isn’t without potential cracks, as open source software running in containers is often pulled from prebuilt binaries with unclear provenance, increasing your potential exposure to known vulnerabilities (CVEs). Consider that vulnerabilities in the open source supply chain are behind some of the largest cybersecurity attacks in recent history — from npm/JavaScript package attacks to the still-shocking case of a longtime contributor planting a [backdoor in the XZ Utils compression library](https://thenewstack.io/unzipping-the-xz-backdoor-and-its-lessons-for-open-source/).

## How Remediation Threatens Developer Velocity
When a vulnerability is discovered, remediation often falls on developers, forcing them to redirect valuable time to fixing instead of innovating. And the problem is getting worse. As the number of CVEs increases, the manual process of vulnerability remediation — involving investigation, rebuilding, retesting and redeploying — becomes a significant challenge to developer velocity and productivity.

Security and DevOps teams need more than a secure starting point; they need to know that their container requirements, from the operating system (OS) level to app dependencies, are assembled regularly, from a known source and free from CVEs.

If you’re looking to fortify your containers against open source software supply chain vulnerabilities, join us on June 26 at 1 p.m. ET | 10 a.m. PT, for a special online event, [ From Vulnerable to Unbreakable: Container Security for Open Source Simplified](https://streamyard.com/watch/FxSx8BQuhkEs).

During this free webinar, Pete Garcin and Evan Prowse of ActiveState and TNS Host Chris Pirillo will explore the advantages and risks of using open source in containers and how you can close critical gaps before they go into production — and keep them closed for good.
