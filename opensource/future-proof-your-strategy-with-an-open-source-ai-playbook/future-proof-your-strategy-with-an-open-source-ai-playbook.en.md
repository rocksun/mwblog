For all the investments corporations are making in AI, the results are decidedly mixed. While the chipmakers and hyperscale cloud platforms are doing [very well](https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/artificial-intelligence-stocks-the-10-best-ai-companies), most businesses are seeing significantly less impressive results.

Recently, MIT NANDA shook things up by reporting research that [95% of enterprise AI pilots fail](https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf). Because they don’t deliver measurable returns to the business, most of the $30 billion to $40 billion enterprises are investing in AI are delivering no returns on investment (ROI), according to MIT NANDA’s “State of AI in Business 2025” survey.

Even so, [AI is non-negotiable](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-create-the-generative-ai-policy-you-needed-yesterday/) for enterprises that want to keep up with their competition, let alone move ahead. The key is to set your organization up for success today, leaning into the best practices of the companies and leaders that are well into their journey. And an upcoming ebook from The New Stack will help you build that road map.
