[Open source software](https://thenewstack.io/open-source/) (OSS) has become the backbone of modern development. It’s flexible, accessible and community-driven, making it a go-to choice for developers and startups alike.
[Docker’s 2024 State of Application Development Report](https://www.docker.com/resources/2024-state-of-application-development-report/) reveals that 59% of developers contributed to OSS projects in the past year, and 72% of those who didn’t are eager to start — highlighting the growing enthusiasm within the OSS ecosystem.
Additionally, the[ Linux Foundation’s 2024 Global Spotlight Insights Report](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/world-of-open-source-global-2024?hsLang=en) found that 64% of respondents reported increased business value from OSS use. But for many enterprises, there comes a time when it’s best to graduate from the fully OSS version — where the cost is engineers, maintenance and infrastructure internally — and transition to the paid enterprise version where the costs and risks are pushed out.

Scaling your OSS usage in the right ways can keep your engineering team focused on innovation and efficiency. Here are the key facets to consider:

**Evaluating the Costs of Your Open Source Stack**
**Maintenance Overhead**
While OSS comes with no price tag, the resources and know-how required to maintain it can be significant. Configurations, upgrades and compatibility checks demand expertise.

Every OSS tool has dependencies, and managing those dependencies — especially across distributed systems — requires valuable engineering resources. Keeping environments consistent, rolling out updates without breaking functionality and troubleshooting unforeseen issues all contribute to the total cost of ownership (TCO).

Successful companies closely monitor their investments in OSS, including what they spend on engineers, infrastructure and maintenance (including legal costs). Understanding these actual costs makes it easier to weigh them against the value of paid options and additional features.

**Managing Security Vulnerabilities**
The OSS community does an incredible job maintaining and patching software, but their timelines don’t always align with organizational needs. Vulnerabilities in popular OSS, such as the infamous Log4j vulnerability, have demonstrated the catastrophic impact of [security](https://thenewstack.io/security/) lapses on businesses. These incidents highlight why with certain critical parts of the stack enterprises choose to go beyond relying solely on community-driven updates.

Paid enterprise versions of OSS often bake in robust vulnerability management features that provide guaranteed, proactive support. For example, [Red Hat](https://www.openshift.com/try?utm_content=inline+mention)’s enterprise Linux offering goes beyond the free Fedora distribution by providing not just patches, but hardened security policies, automated compliance tools and guaranteed service-level agreements (SLAs) for critical updates. This means enterprises using Red Hat can quickly address vulnerabilities without waiting for community-driven timelines, reducing the risk of prolonged exposure to potential exploits.

Enterprise-grade software building solutions frequently include tools like real-time vulnerability scanning and dependency tracking. These features allow organizations to identify and address issues in the software supply chain — a critical concern given that the average application can depend on hundreds of open source libraries. For organizations running mission-critical workloads, this enhanced level of protection is more than just indispensable; it’s a requirement of doing business in regulated environments.

**Support Challenges**
When OSS breaks, where do you turn? Community forums and GitHub issues can be helpful, but they lack the accountability enterprises need. Waiting days — or even weeks — for a resolution can lead to expensive downtime and frustrated teams. Paid enterprise-grade solutions, by contrast, offer 24/7 support, SLAs and access to dedicated technical experts who resolve issues efficiently.

Beyond reactive support, enterprise-grade solutions also provide proactive support. This includes best practices for setup, configuration and optimization, ensuring that your teams use and configure OSS tools correctly from the start. Proactive guidance can be invaluable for organizations without extensive internal knowledge or expertise, as it helps prevent issues before they arise and ensures smoother operations. With this level of partnership, enterprises can not only resolve problems faster but also avoid them entirely by setting up their environments for success.

**Sustainability Risks**
OSS projects thrive on community contributions, but sustainability isn’t guaranteed. Projects can lose traction or be abandoned, leaving users scrambling for alternatives or forced to maintain legacy codebases themselves. It is critical to look for options that best suit the desired outcome here. Sometimes simply donating to the project can create the desired outcome. For parts of your stack where continuity is critical, relying on a paid third party that can ensure long-term accountability is often the better choice.

**Maximize ROI With Enterprise OSS: Build Better, Faster**
Investing in enterprise OSS isn’t just about acquiring additional features; it’s about empowering your teams to deliver more impactful results. Enterprise solutions free up engineering resources to focus on what matters most: building better applications, faster. By removing the burden of manual maintenance, patching and dependency management, enterprise OSS allows your teams to direct their energy toward innovation and higher-value work.

For companies in growth mode, enterprise OSS amplifies the opportunity to create scalable, secure and reliable applications. Features like proactive vulnerability scanning, automated compliance checks and 24/7 support ensure your foundation is solid, enabling your teams to build and scale without interruption. The ROI is clear: When your infrastructure is robust and secure, your engineering teams can ship products faster, iterate more effectively and deliver greater value to customers.

**Building OSS Strategies That Work**
It’s essential to recognize that OSS adoption strategies are nuanced and diverse. Many organizations find success by tailoring their OSS usage to their unique circumstances, whether through paid solutions, internal processes or community collaboration.

**Balancing Internal Capabilities and Enterprise Solutions**
Organizations with mature open source program offices (OSPOs) or robust internal frameworks often excel at managing OSS security, maintenance and sustainability. These companies leverage expertise and infrastructure to mitigate risks and maximize the benefits of OSS without necessarily relying on enterprise solutions. For such teams, building internal tools or processes may align better with their strategic goals.

**Strengthening the OSS Ecosystem**
Supporting OSS projects directly through contributions, funding or memberships in groups like the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) or the Linux Foundation is another way organizations can ensure sustainability. By actively participating in the community, companies not only help maintain critical software but also foster collaboration, innovation and long-term growth.

Companies that prioritize funding OSS don’t just contribute resources — they invest in the backbone of modern technology. Sponsoring maintainers, participating in community events and creating programs to mentor OSS contributors can make a transformative impact. For example, Docker’s sponsorship of open source projects and support for initiatives like Docker Captains highlights a commitment to strengthening the ecosystem while empowering individual developers. By sustaining these efforts, businesses help ensure that OSS projects remain healthy and continue to evolve.

**Differentiating OSS Use Cases**
Not all OSS tools are created equal. Libraries like Log4j often require less external support due to their specialized scope, whereas platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Desktop provide broad, foundational capabilities that benefit greatly from enterprise-grade enhancements.

Understanding the nature of each OSS component helps organizations make informed decisions about when to invest in paid options. It also isn’t always accurate that a paid offering is better maintained than a free one, though more likely.

**Conclusion: From Opportunity to Innovation**
Open source software is an essential part of the [technology ecosystem](https://thenewstack.io/can-open-source-sustain-itself-without-losing-its-soul/), providing unmatched flexibility and innovation potential. But for enterprises looking to accelerate growth, paid OSS solutions unlock the full potential of their teams.

By investing in enterprise-grade OSS, organizations gain access to tools, security and scalability that allow them to focus on delivering more apps, better apps and higher return on investment. Rather than seeing enterprise OSS as an expense, forward-thinking businesses recognize it as a strategic enabler — a way to shift their focus from managing infrastructure to driving innovation.

Paid enterprise OSS solutions deliver the resources and expertise needed to achieve sustained success. By choosing the right tools, your company can focus on what it does best: creating value for customers and staying ahead in a competitive landscape.
