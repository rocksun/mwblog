According to the most recent [Octoverse report](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/?utm_source=the+new+stack&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=inline-mention&utm_campaign=tns+platform#the-state-of-open-source) from GitHub, a staggering 1 billion contributions were made to public and open source projects over the course of 2024. That’s an average of over 2.7 million contributions per day, or roughly 32 every second.

In relatively short order, open source development has gone from controversial fringe movement to mainstream development model — to something even greater.

While proprietary projects still outnumber open source, the rate of growth seen in the latter has reached new heights as of late. In 2024, there was a 98% increase in the total number of open source projects on GitHub.

So, what’s behind this growth? Is this a flash-in-the-pan uptick, or is it indicative of a consistent change in trajectory for the growth of open source development? Let’s [take a closer look at the data](https://thenewstack.io/the-metamorphosis-of-open-source-an-industry-in-transition/) and determine exactly what this milestone means and what the finer details can tell us about what might be on the horizon for the world of open source software (OSS).

## A Signal of Long-Term Growth for Open Source?
When we look closer at the data from GitHub’s annual report, we can uncover a number of interesting and encouraging trends.

First and foremost, contributions grew in large part because of a significant increase in the number of developers participating in open source projects in the first place. In fact, in 2024, GitHub saw an all-time high of 1.4 million new developers contribute to open source projects.

When it comes to the long-term implications of GitHub’s 1 billion contribution milestone, this detail could not be more significant. Rather than simply being the result of more involvement from existing contributors, we’re seeing that this growth in contributions coincides directly with community growth — which holds significant promise for the long-term growth and viability of the open source movement.

The platform surpassing 1 billion annual open source contributions alone is a milestone worthy of celebration. However, when we consider that first-time contributors played a significant role in reaching it, it becomes clear that this is no fluke, but rather a fundamental recalibration of open source’s potential for growth.

## Where Are 1.4 Million New Contributors Coming From?
Looking at this group of 1.4 million newcomers, we can identify a number of compelling trends, including where this community growth is taking place.

Although the preponderance of contributions is still originating from the U.S., many of the new contributions have also come from places like India, Germany, Japan and Singapore. In fact, India is expected to have the world’s largest developer population on GitHub by 2028.

The platform is also seeing significant growth across Africa and Latin America, yet another positive indication that the 1 billion contributions milestone is representative of a continued, long-term trend in favor of open source development.

Another compelling finding is that the majority of these new contributors are joining in commercially backed and generative AI (GenAI) projects — showing that enterprise support and the recent emergence of advanced AI is helping to fuel interest in the open source model.

An additional major benchmark from the Octoverse report is the emergence of [Python](https://thenewstack.io/python/) as the most used language on GitHub for the first time. With its widespread application across fields such as machine learning (ML), data science and automation, the rise in Python usage is consistent with large numbers of first-time contributors joining the open source community from across the STEM world — rather than solely software developers.

While it’s hard to say precisely where these fields are headed, it’s safe to say that the general direction is up. Once again, this indicates less of a simple growth trend and more of a realignment of open source’s place in the pecking order of software development.

Finally, and perhaps most promising of all, is the role that students are playing in the growth of the open source community. The Octoverse report reveals that the [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education) program had over 7 million verified participants last year.

At the same time, the organization recorded 100% year-over-year growth among students, teachers and open source maintainers adopting [GitHub Copilot](https://thenewstack.io/a-developer-health-check-on-github-copilot-and-ai-assistants/) as part of its complimentary access program. The report also clocked a 92% increase in the use of Jupyter Notebooks.

Taken together, these findings suggest that people in data science, AI, ML and academia are increasingly using GitHub and making open source a more central part of their development. This shows the dual-pronged effect that AI is having on open source development: it both generates interest among students but also enables them to participate in projects. As a result, they become able, productive developers contributing to this growing body of open source projects.

## Beyond Growth: Open Source’s Future
As the world’s largest repository of open source projects with the most active community of contributors, GitHub and its growth is in many ways a one-to-one translation of what’s happening in the world of [OSS development](https://thenewstack.io/open-source/) — and the latest Octoverse report is a clear indication of the model making serious strides in the larger tech landscape.

Surpassing 1 billion contributions is undoubtedly a big deal. However, in many ways, it’s the smaller findings that are most telling and most meaningful when it comes to the future of the open source movement.

When we look at the fact that [over 90% of Fortune 100 companies now use GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-git), it’s increasingly clear that open source has transcended its origins as an outsider, contrarian movement. With open source now playing a pivotal role in AI, software development and commercial innovation, it’s proof that open source software is more than just thriving; it’s shaping the future of technology.
