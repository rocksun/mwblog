Looking back at 20 years in the [open source](https://thenewstack.io/open-source/) ecosystem, I’ve learned that this journey has been anything but straightforward. When I started [XWiki](https://xwiki.com/) in 2004, I envisioned building open source software to help organizations collaborate and share knowledge. I was unaware at the time that open source is a way of thinking and how resilient it must be to stay faithful to that vision rather than merely a technical decision.

Along the way, I made mistakes, encountered obstacles, and learned painful lessons, yet those experiences helped to mold my current perspective on open source, business, and success.

If I’ve learned anything, [open source is all about the people](https://thenewstack.io/the-future-of-open-source-needs-more-give-and-less-take/). Yes, the code is crucial, but the true power lies in the collaboration of individuals and organizations. I’ve witnessed firsthand how open source develops a feeling of shared purpose, with users serving as contributors, partners, and advocates rather than just paying customers.

One of the most important takeaways is how [community-driven development](https://thenewstack.io/why-the-best-open-source-is-community-led-open-source/) may result in more sustainable and adaptable products. Unlike closed systems, where users are limited to whatever features the firm deems significant, open source users have direct control over the roadmap.

## Not an Easy Path
Open source is not an easy path. I was without a salary for several years, and we battled to make ends meet. Looking back, I was overly optimistic — I assumed providing a free and open platform would organically attract paying clients. While this is partially true, I also discovered that free-riders who consume the product without contributing to its development can limit the software’s potential to be sustained and improved over time.

You need to [educate your clients](https://thenewstack.io/want-killer-features-foster-dev-user-communication/) about why they should support the initiative and demonstrate the benefit beyond the “free” component.

## Being Resilient in the Long Run
Resilience has been a common theme throughout the XWiki journey. There were countless moments when we could have used a proprietary model or taken shortcuts to generate rapid cash flow. But I’ve always believed in the long-term value of open source and its guiding principles, which include transparency, user control, and community-driven development. It’s not always easy to turn down venture capital offers or resist pressure to commercialize everything. However, I firmly believe that success isn’t just about growing fast; it’s about growing meaningfully.

One of the things I would change if I were starting over is how we approached freemium. We gave too much away early without clearly defining what would be part of a paid model. Over time, we developed a better balance. We now offer business-ready extensions as part of a paid plan while keeping XWiki’s core open source. We can finance development in this way without sacrificing our commitment to open source principles.

The notion that businesses should be designed to last is one that I have always advocated and will continue to do so. I’ve never been drawn to the “quick win” way of thinking. It serves as a reminder that we didn’t take the simple route, and I’m pleased we didn’t when I hear others talking about taking quick breaks or pursuing the next big thing. Maintaining our independence, steering clear of venture funding, and adhering to moral business standards have helped us to maintain authority over our vision and remain loyal to our values.

## Focus on Digital Sovereignty
The rise of Big Tech has emphasized one of the most significant truths I’ve learned: [the need for digital sovereignty](https://thenewstack.io/how-data-sovereignty-and-data-privacy-affect-your-kubernetes-adoption/). Over time, I’ve observed how centralized platforms can slowly erode consumers’ authority over their data and software. Today, more than ever, I believe that open source is a crucial path to regaining control — whether you’re an individual, a business, or a government. With open source software, you own your infrastructure, and you’re not subject to the whims of a vendor deciding to change prices, terms, or even direction.

I’ve learned that part of being resilient in this industry means providing alternatives to centralized solutions. We built [CryptPad ](https://cryptpad.fr/)— to offer an encrypted, privacy-respecting alternative to tools like Google Docs. It hasn’t been easy, but it’s a project I believe in because it aligns with my core belief: people should control their data.

I would improve the way the community communicates the benefits of open source. The conversation all too frequently concentrates on “free vs. paid” software. In reality, what matters is the distinction between dependence and freedom. I’ve concluded that we need to explain better how individuals may take charge of their data, privacy, and future by utilizing open source.

## The Hardest Lesson: Prioritize User Experience
One of the lessons I’ve learned the hard way is that building great software is not enough. Even with the best intentions and a great product, users will leave if they struggle to understand or use your software. I wish user experience had become our priority from the start. Rather than concentrating on making the platform user-friendly for everyone, we first prioritized aspects that would appeal to technical users: flexibility and customization. This was an error.

Through experience, I have come to understand that what drives acceptance, especially in open source, is usability. The program should empower users rather than terrify them. If I could go back and redo anything, I would invest more time in ensuring that our products were clear from the beginning. Gaining your users’ trust and fostering enduring connections with them depends entirely on providing a positive user experience.

## Looking Back
In retrospect, I believe I underestimated the amount of time needed to establish a long-term open source company. If I had to do it over, I would have given the growing process more time and space in my schedule. Even though it can be tempting to search for shortcuts, it’s rarely the wisest course of action because open source projects need care and time to grow.

Additionally, I would have focused more on the marketing aspect of things. All too frequently, open-source initiatives overlook the significance of conveying value to non-technical audiences in favor of emphasizing the technical qualities of their products. A lesson I’ve learned the hard way is that you can have the best software in the world, but if you don’t explain why it matters to the people who need it, you’ll struggle to get the adoption it deserves.

## Looking Ahead
Open source will only become more significant, particularly as more businesses place a high value on digital sovereignty, privacy, and transparency. Open source will be crucial in providing alternatives that adapt to these changes as new regulations, especially in Europe, aim for Big Tech.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned about open source, it’s that it’s a long game. Although the open source community has experienced splits and changes as business objectives have changed over time, the fundamental values of openness, community, and control have remained constant.

## Final Thoughts
The future of open source is tied to the growing demand for digital sovereignty and privacy. With regulations like the DSA and DMA in Europe, I see a renewed focus on breaking the monopolies of Big Tech and encouraging competition. This is a space where open source can thrive.

One thing is clear: open source is here to stay, and its role in shaping the future of technology will only grow. What started as a small movement driven by a few passionate developers has become modern technology’s backbone. And for me, that’s the most important lesson — open source isn’t just about the code but the community, the freedom, and the future we’re all building together.
