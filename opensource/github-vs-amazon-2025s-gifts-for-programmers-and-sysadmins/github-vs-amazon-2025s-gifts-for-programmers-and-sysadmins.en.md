For this year’s holiday celebrations, Hallmark made a special Christmas tree ornament, a tiny monitor [displaying screens from the classic video game “Oregon Trail.”](https://amzn.to/48LIIPw) (“Recall the fun of leading a team of oxen and a wagon loaded with provisions from Missouri to the West.”)

![Hallmark's Oregon Trail ornament for Christmas trees — screenshot of Amazon](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/06df5cee-hallmarks-oregon-trail-ornament-for-christmas-trees-screenshot-of-amazon.png)

That’s what’s different about 2025: Top sites and major brands are now targeting the “tech” demographic — including programmers, sysadmins and even vintage game enthusiasts!

And when Hallmark and Amazon are chasing the same customers as GitHub and Copilot, you know there’s been a strange yet meaningful shift in the culture.

So, with only a few shopping days left, The New Stack [offers up](https://thenewstack.io/the-2021-tns-gift-guide-4-ways-to-help-connect-to-community/) its [annual gift guide](https://thenewstack.io/2023s-gift-ideas-for-the-programmer-in-your-life/) for [geeks](https://thenewstack.io/tns-gift-guide-for-2020-practical-projects-and-fabulous-fun/), with the hopes it’ll help you sort the gifting for even the grouchiest greybeard in your life.

## GitHub’s Copilot Christmas

While AI was conquering the world, GitHub published its [“Ultimate gift guide for the developer in your life”](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/the-ultimate-gift-guide-for-the-developer-in-your-life/) just as soon as doors opened on [Black Friday](https://thenewstack.io/how-amazon-prepares-for-black-friday/). So if you’re wondering, “Should I push to production on New Year’s Eve?” GitHub recommends their new [“GitHub Copilot Amazeball,”](https://thegithubshop.com/products/github-copilot-amazeball) which it describes as “GitHub’s magical collectible ready to weigh in on your toughest calls … !”

![Cropped screenshot of GitHub Copilot Amazeball — answering should I ship question with Ship It](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/37def4e4-cropped-screenshot-of-github-copilot-amazeball-answering-should-i-ship-question-with-ship-it.png)

[Copilot](https://thenewstack.io/go-big-or-go-home-what-github-learned-building-copilot/) isn’t involved — questions are randomly matched to the answers printed on the side of a triangle-shaped die floating in water. “[Y]ou’ll get answers straight from the repo of destiny with a simple shake,” GitHub promises — just like the Magic 8 Ball of yore. “Get your hands on this must-have collectible and enjoy the cosmic guidance — no real context switching required!”

And GitHub’s “Gift Guide for Developers” also suggests GitHub-branded [ugly holiday socks](https://thegithubshop.com/products/ugly-holiday-socks?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=holiday_list) and [keyboard keycaps with GitHub’s mascots](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/lifestyle/products/key-caps-2-0-assorted-pack-of-4).

![GitHub sells branded socks — screenshot](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/fb193af7-github-sells-branded-socks-screenshot.png)

But GitHub isn’t the only major tech site with a shopping page targeting the geek demographic. Firefox is [selling merchandise](https://mozilla-na.myspreadshop.com/say+hi+to+kit!?collection=pFGwhvwYfR) with [its new mascot](https://www.firefox.com/en-GB/kit/). Even the Free Software Foundation has its [own shop](https://shop.fsf.org/), with [Emacs T-shirts](https://shop.fsf.org/tshirts-hoodies/gnu-emacs-logo-t-shirt), [GNU beanies](https://shop.fsf.org/tshirts-hoodies/gnu-beanie) and a [stuffed baby gnu](https://shop.fsf.org/gear/stuffed-baby-gnu-2) (“One of our most sought-after items … “). Plus an FSF-branded [antisurveillance webcam guard](https://shop.fsf.org/stickers/antisurveillance-webcam-guard).

Maybe Dr. Seuss can write a new book: “How the Geeks Stole Christmas.”

Because this newfound interest in the geek demographic seems to have spread to the largest sites of all:

![Google search result (screenshot) of Gifts for Computer Programmers pulls up Amazon page](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/9dad0e31-google-search-result-screenshot-of-gifts-for-computer-programmers-pulls-up-amazon-page.png)

## Christmas for Coders

Google searches on “Gifts for Programmers” now point to a special page on Amazon with suggestions like [Linux crossword puzzles](https://amzn.to/4oVxSwq).

![Linux Crosswords (book from Amazon)](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/3c3f38b9-linux-crosswords-book-from-amazon.jpg)

But what coder could resist a book called [“Cooking for Programmers?”](https://amzn.to/4oWpGw8)

“Each recipe is written as source code in a different programming language,” explains the book’s description, “making it not only delicious but educational as well.” From pizza toast to tomato coconut soup — and from Rust to Ruby — author [Richard Wurzer](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Richard-Wurzer/author/B0BVJQCFNV?ref=ap_rdr&shoppingPortalEnabled=true&ccs_id=78b3a8fd-1bd7-42b9-ba31-9ab424bf36d5) urges you to “grab your apron and command line.”

![Screenshot from Amazon sample of Cooking for Programmers](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/aa8357eb-screenshot-from-amazon-sample-of-cooking-for-programmers.png)

Transform daunting kitchen chores with the familiar comfort of code — like the JSON in this recipe for oven-roasted vegetables.

`name: "peppers",  
quantity: 100,  
unit: "g"`

The book is filled with colorful recipes — thanks to syntax highlighting, which turns the letters red, blue and green. There are also real cooking instructions, but presented as an array of strings, with both ingredients and instructions ultimately logged as messages to the console.

There’s Java, JavaScript, Python, Perl, PHP, TypeScript and more. “Let’s get cooking and have fun,” suggests author Wurzer.

And there’s even a recipe for espresso.

Although if that’s not enough for the programmer in your life, buy them a [candle with their favorite scent](https://amzn.to/4iRMvzw).

![Smells like a closed ticket scented candle (screenshot of Amazon)](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/ba7dcd34-smells-like-a-closed-ticket-scented-candle-screenshot-of-amazon.png)

## Ghosts of Christmas Past

But Amazon isn’t the only site [selling programmer-themed gifts](https://www.etsy.com/market/gifts_for_programmer).

![Screenshot of Etsy programmer gifts](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/4fa0da9a-screenshot-of-etsy-programmer-gifts.png)

Yes, Etsy has a whole category dedicated just to art prints for programmers — including one showing what “Programmer” would look like [as a card in a Tarot deck](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4388895508/the-software-developer-tarot-poster).

[![Photo from Etsy of an art print for programmers — programmer as Tarot card](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/dcc7538d-image-from-etsy-programmer-art-print-tarot-card-il_1588xn.7346365975_ku6r.webp)](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4388895508/the-software-developer-tarot-poster)

For your Christmas tree, [four](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4398089513/personalized-software-developer-corner) [different](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4390039749/software-developer-ornament-mini-coding) [sellers](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4395008771/programmer-desk-2d-flat-ornament-2025) on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4407618052/personalized-computer-programmer) claimed to be offering a homemade “software developer ornament”:

![From Etsy — personalized Christmas ornament — il_1588xN.7413122444_fply](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/4426a616-from-etsy-personalized-christmas-ornament-il_1588xn.7413122444_fply.webp)

The ornaments look nearly identical — and three of the accounts were suspiciously opened within the last three months — suggesting “gifts for programmers” has become its own attractive demographic for sellers.

But the [coder bear minifig](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1789745736/coder-bear-mini-figurine-the-perfect) is adorable.

[![Coder bear minifig — screenshot of page for Etsy seller CasualChicken](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/9845f585-coder-bear-minifig-screenshot-of-page-for-etsy-seller-casualchicken.png)](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1789745736/coder-bear-mini-figurine-the-perfect)

One Etsy artisan is even selling hand-blown glass Christmas tree ornaments that are [shaped like ancient VHS tapes](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1522889530/handblown-glass-vhs-tape-christmas).

[![VHS tape handblown Christmas ornament — Image from page of Etsy seller LoveAndVictory — il_1588xN.5308950976_8pj8](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/ac56a5ca-vhs-tape-handblown-christmas-ornament-image-from-page-of-etsy-seller-loveandvictory-il_1588xn.5308950976_8pj8.avif)](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1522889530/handblown-glass-vhs-tape-christmas)

And other sites are also selling coder-themed decorations for your favorite programmer’s Christmas tree. Hallmark also sells an ornament shaped like [an Xbox 360](https://www.hallmark.com/ornaments/keepsake-ornaments/xbox-360-console-ornament-with-light-and-sound-5QXI8292.html) — and another shaped like a [tiny vintage Nintendo Entertainment System](https://www.hallmark.com/ornaments/keepsake-ornaments/nintendo-entertainment-system-nes-console-ornament-with-light-and-sound-1QXV1079.html).

[![From Hallmark dot com — Super-Mario-Bros-NES-Console-Keepsake-Ornament_1QXV1079_01](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/d3bb50aa-from-hallmark-dot-com-super-mario-bros-nes-console-keepsake-ornament_1qxv1079_01.jpg)](https://www.hallmark.com/ornaments/keepsake-ornaments/nintendo-entertainment-system-nes-console-ornament-with-light-and-sound-1QXV1079.html)

Although for something more challenging, Adafruit is selling its own [DIY kits for colorful, high-tech ornaments](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4036).

![Screenshot from Adafruit dot com — DIY Ornament Kit — 6cm Diameter](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/b5b78f24-screenshot-from-adafruit-dot-com-diy-ornament-kit-6cm-diameter.png)

## When ‘Techno Claus’ Visited CBS

Everyone’s getting in on the action — even the CBS News site. One of its [recent articles](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2025-holiday-gift-ideas-from-techno-claus/) explains how “Techno Claus (who looks suspiciously like tech correspondent [David Pogue](https://davidpogue.com/)), emerges from the fireplace” to share his surprisingly good list of tech gifts.

For an added dose of holiday cheer, Pogue decided to write all of his reviews in rhyme.

And thus we learn that for the shockingly low price of $15, you can get a [Bluetooth-enabled beanie cap](https://www.amazon.com/Yontune-Bluetooth-Rechargeable-Occasions-Christmas/dp/B0FLXNWGQZ/) with a built-in headlamp. (” … This keeps you warm, and it lights up the way. It’s even got speakers — just pair and hit ‘Play!'”)

Though the ultimate stocking stuffer would be this [miniature TV set with a one-inch screen](https://tinycircuits.com/products/tinytv-2). (“You load your own movies; there is a remote. For too much TV, it’s a sweet antidote.”)

![From Tiny Circuits dot com — TinyTV 2 with tiny remote Image-11crop1x1_1800x1800](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/dbaab990-from-tiny-circuits-dot-com-tinytv-2-with-tiny-remote-image-11crop1x1_1800x1800.webp)

And for $140, you can put your iPhone in a case that gives it [a physical keyboard like the BlackBerry](https://www.clicks.tech/). (“Like, nobody ever loves typing on glass, A problem this iPhone case tackles with class.”)

## T-Shirts for Sysadmins

Marketing to the geek demographic is strange enough. But what’s even stranger is how specific it’s gotten.

Amazon now sells [T-shirts for sysadmins](https://www.amazon.com/Sysadmin-never-wrong-System-T-Shirt/dp/B08NYW2X91/).

![Sysadmin t-shirt — image from Amazon — 91PrYF2wbqL._CLa_2140,2000_612GC+lUEZL.png_0,0,2140,2000+0.0,0.0,2140.0,2000.0_AC_SX466_](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/7ea1a3ee-sysadmin-t-shirt-image-from-amazon-91pryf2wbql._cla_21402000_612gcluezl.png_00214020000.00.02140.02000.0_ac_sx466_.jpg)

There are even T-shirts [for hobbyists working on homebrew projects](https://amzn.to/4pzAbGE).

![Funny YouTube Video t-shirt (image from Amazon) — 81GRSv4AIFL._AC_SX569_](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/23fa085c-funny-youtube-video-t-shirt-image-from-amazon-81grsv4aifl._ac_sx569_.jpg)

But some programmers might prefer their shirts from [FreeWear.org](https://www.freewear.org), which donates part of the proceeds from every sale to its corresponding FOSS project or organization. (There are T-shirts for [Linux](https://www.freewear.org/null), [Gnome](https://www.freewear.org/GNOME) and the [C programming language](https://www.freewear.org/C) — and even one making a joke about [how hard it is to exit Vim](https://www.freewear.org/Vim).)

[![Vim t shirt from FreeWear dot org FW0363](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/12/441fc152-vim-t-shirt-from-freewear-dot-org-fw0363.png)](https://www.freewear.org/Vim)

But maybe it all proves that there’s something for everybody. That’s the real heartwarming message behind these extra-geeky Christmas gifts — that in the end, tech is, after all, still a community, with its own hallowed traditions and shared celebrations.

It’s just that instead of singing Christmas carols, we make jokes about Vim.

So there’s another message to the abundance of gifts for the technical community: that the people who want you to smile are all around you. Everyone’s put a lot of thought into this — and it looks like they’re all having a lot of fun.

And somewhere in there is some genuine appreciation for their favorite fellow geeks.

So deck the halls, and drink an eggnog toast to your own favorite sysadmin.

In the past, we’ve published our own [gift](https://thenewstack.io/tns-gift-guide-for-2020-practical-projects-and-fabulous-fun/) [guides](https://thenewstack.io/the-2021-tns-gift-guide-4-ways-to-help-connect-to-community/) for [programmers](https://thenewstack.io/2023s-gift-ideas-for-the-programmer-in-your-life/) and [other](https://thenewstack.io/special-gift-ideas-for-that-technical-someone-in-your-life/) tech folk. But in 2025, the rest of the world joined in the fun!
