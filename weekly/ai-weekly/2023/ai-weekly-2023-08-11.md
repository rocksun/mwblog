## Stability AI launches StableCode, an LLM for code generation

Stability AI is well known for its Stable Diffusion text-to-image generation model, but that’s not all the generative AI startup is interested in developing. Stability AI is now getting into code generation too.

## Multiplayer raises $3M for AI-based distributed software development

Multiplayer Main Features:

- AI Assist: Generates comprehensive components required for distributed software development, including system architectures, APIs, service implementations, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and documentation.
- Visualizes System Architecture: Provides a holistic view of the system architecture while allowing for detailed examination of specific features and real-time changes.
- Design Intent Communication: Consolidates multiple document types (e.g., platform diagrams, APIs, sketches, rich-text docs, source code) to effectively communicate design intent for a particular feature.
- Formal Design Reviews: Facilitates design reviews and enables feedback from all stakeholders (team leads, developers, QA, CTOs, DevOps, etc.) before moving forward with implementation.
- Real-Time Collaboration: Supports real-time collaboration among distributed teams, similar to tools like Figma, but specifically designed for backend development.
- Version Control and Branching: Enables version control and branching to manage code changes effectively.
- Centralized System Dashboard: Ensures system architecture is documented in a shared, company-owned space where it can be maintained and the platform’s evolution can be tracked.
