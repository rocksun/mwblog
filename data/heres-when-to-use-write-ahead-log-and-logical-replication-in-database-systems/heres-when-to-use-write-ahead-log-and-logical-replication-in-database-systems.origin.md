When it comes to database replication, two widely used methods are Write Ahead Log (WAL) and logical replication. These techniques are essential for
[maintaining data availability](https://thenewstack.io/maintaining-data-resiliency-in-the-age-of-kubernetes/), facilitating disaster recovery, and [scaling up database systems](https://thenewstack.io/techniques-for-scaling-applications-with-a-database/). Both require different strategies to grasp their advantages and limitations due to the differences in structures, capabilities, and practical applications.
## Write-Ahead Log (WAL)
The method known as Write-Ahead Log (WAL) is commonly utilized in database systems such as
[PostgreSQL](https://thenewstack.io/postgresql-takes-a-new-turn/). It involves leveraging the flow of modifications stored in the WAL files to duplicate data from a database to one or more secondary replicas. This is how it breaks down.
In WAL, the main database guarantees durability by recording all changes to its Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) files before finalizing them in the data files. The secondary replicas then fetch these WAL files from the server and apply them sequentially to their own data files. This replication technique requires asynchronous communication between the secondary servers to uphold the consistency and
[reliability of data](https://thenewstack.io/its-time-for-data-reliability-engineering/) throughout the system.
WAL maintains
[data integrity and consistency by copying changes](https://thenewstack.io/change-data-capture-for-real-time-access-to-backend-databases/) from the database’s transaction log. This process ensures that the replicated data stays synchronized with the data, ensuring integrity throughout. Additionally, WAL supports point-in-time recovery, allowing standby servers to replay WAL files for a specific time, enabling recovery in case of failures or data corruption. In the event of a failover where the primary server is unavailable, WAL enables a transition by promoting a standby server to become the new primary using up-to-date WAL files for continuous operations.
WAL maintains data integrity and consistency by replicating changes from the primary database transaction log preserving data integrity during replication. This method also impacts the performance of the database as changes are first recorded in WAL files before being applied to data files. This approach allows the primary database to operate efficiently and underwrite loads. Furthermore, WAL is well suited for disaster recovery scenarios as standby servers are constantly updated with changes from the database, ensuring they are current and prepared to take over in case of a server failure. Ensuring a dependable backup
[plan for the database system guarantees disaster recovery](https://thenewstack.io/supercharge-your-disaster-recovery-plan-in-5-simple-steps/) measures.
While using WAL, for replication to be effective it’s essential to be aware of some downsides. Sometimes replication lag can occur when standby replicas fall behind the server due to network delays or high activity levels. This lag can result in discrepancies between the data on the standby servers, impacting data consistency. Moreover, manual steps may be needed to designate a server as the new primary in some situations. This manual process could cause delays. It requires involvement, potentially prolonging the time needed to restore operations.
## Logical Replication
On the other hand, logical replication is a technique used in database systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and
[MongoDB](https://thenewstack.io/mongodb-vs-scylladb-performance-scalability-and-cost/). It operates at a level of replicating SQL statements or data modifications. Unlike WAL, which replicates changes at a byte level, logical replication provides an [approach to synchronizing data](https://thenewstack.io/the-zero-trust-approach-to-data-management/). This method has different advantages and challenges due to its design and functionality.
In replication, the primary database sends sets of changes (which may include SQL statements or row modifications) to replica servers. These change sets are typically transferred through a replication connection between the replica servers. Upon receiving these change sets, replica servers implement them in their datasets by executing SQL statements or applying modifications. This method allows the backup servers to remain updated with the database by mirroring the changes in their data sets. Logical replication typically functions on a model where publishers distribute changes to subscribers, enabling replication setups and scalability options.
Logical replication provides benefits compared to methods such as WAL. Firstly, it offers the advantage of replication, allowing for the replication of tables or databases rather than all changes, which enhances flexibility and efficiency. Secondly, it enables replication, facilitating synchronization across types of databases, especially useful in environments with diverse systems. Moreover, logical replication grants control over replication behavior including conflict resolution and data transformation, leading to accurate data synchronization management. Depending on the setup, logical replication can function asynchronously or synchronously, providing options to prioritize performance or data consistency based on requirements. These capabilities establish replication as a robust tool for maintaining synchronized data in distributed systems.
Logical replication presents a level of adaptability for administrators by allowing them to select which data to replicate for targeted synchronization purposes. This feature streamlines the process by replicating tables or databases and reducing unnecessary workload. Additionally, its support for replication promotes synchronization between database types — facilitating seamless data migration and integration across varied systems within an organization. Furthermore, through data transformation during the replication process, logical replication permits format adjustments or data cleansing when necessary. This function guarantees that information stays uniform and compatible across systems, improving data quality and usability.
While logical replication offers benefits it also comes with its set of challenges. To start with it usually requires resources compared to methods, like WAL. The process of parsing and executing SQL commands can strain system performance. Furthermore, there is a chance of data inconsistencies if the replication process falls behind due to transaction loads or network delays, which could lead to discrepancies between the primary and backup databases. Configuring and managing replication setups can be more intricate than using methods like WAL. This

## Comparing WAL and Logical Replication
WAL is often preferred due to its costs as it copies changes at the byte level, which is more efficient. On the other hand, logical replication might lead to expenses especially when handling
[large data volumes or complex SQL](https://thenewstack.io/processing-large-data-sets-in-fine-grained-parallel-streams-with-sql/) commands. This increased cost can be attributed to the necessity of parsing and processing SQL commands, which can consume resources in cases where significant data modifications occur or intricate queries are used.
## Data Consistency
WAL guarantees data consistency by replicating changes from the transaction log, ensuring the replica stays in sync with the primary database. In contrast, logical replication may exhibit consistency, mainly if there is a delay in replicating changes from the database. This could result in a time gap between when changes are made on the primary and when they are reflected on the replica, potentially causing discrepancies between the two databases. Nonetheless, once replication catches up, data consistency will be re-established.
## Flexibility
Logical replication is known for its adaptability and flexibility in choosing what data to replicate and supporting environment types. Through replication, administrators can select tables or databases for replication, customizing synchronization based on their requirements. Moreover, it enables replication between database types, simplifying the process of data migration and system integration across platforms. On the other hand, WAL follows an approach to data replication. It replicates all changes at a byte level without the ability to selectively replicate data elements. Additionally, it necessitates using the database engine on both standby servers, which limits its effectiveness in environments with mixed database technologies.

## Conclusion
Write Ahead Log (WAL) and logical replication play roles in achieving availability, disaster recovery and scalability in database systems. WAL is ideal for scenarios prioritizing data consistency with performance impact, such as disaster recovery setups. On the other hand logical replication provides
[flexibility and control](https://thenewstack.io/how-a-flexible-control-plane-helps-deploy-apps-on-kubernetes/) over replication behavior making it a good fit for complex environments with diverse needs.
Architects and administrators must understand the differences to design resilient database replication setups. Combining Write Ahead Log (WAL) with replication, in a hybrid consistency model is recommended for highly resilient systems requiring fault tolerance.
