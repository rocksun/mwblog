Whether it’s predicting customer behavior, optimizing supply chains, or enhancing public services, **the impact of data analytics is here to stay and grow**.

But that comes with another smart choice to make. With hundreds of platforms created for different needs and industries, it can get overwhelming to decide what are the best data analytics tools for our specific case.

So, **what will you get from this blog? **I’ll aim to simplify the process of reviewing all the tool options by focusing on a **data analytics tools list designed for each industry’s unique use cases**, helping you make an informed decision. Let’s get into it!

## Why are Data Analytics Tools Important
Data analytics tools are created to **collect, process, understand, and visualize data to eventually obtain valuable information from it**. We’ll find them for general purposes, like Tableau, or for more complex and detailed objectives like tailored solutions for healthcare.

These tools are present at every step of the data lifecycle, from raw data to action points. Their capabilities start from **data collection and integration**, allowing teams to import data from different sources like databases or cloud services, even from automated data pipelines where the flow is consistent. This way, businesses can obtain a comprehensive view of their operations and make the right decisions accordingly.

After the data is collected, **data analytics tools can also be used to clean, organize,** and adapt it to the right format. This can mean removing duplicates, finding missing values, and even adding value by merging external datasets. This is a crucial capability, as **every process and AI model is only as good as the quality of the data it’s using.**

Finally, data analytics tools also **transform complex datasets into actionable insights**, providing teams with resources like dashboards and reports to help them visualize and understand their data and then take the necessary steps.

These are some of the qualities that data analytics tools have, but the list extends beyond that, depending on the use case and complexity of the tool.
