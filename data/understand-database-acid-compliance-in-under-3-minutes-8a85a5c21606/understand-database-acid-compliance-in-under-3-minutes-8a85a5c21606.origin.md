# Understand Database ACID Compliance in Under 3 Minutes
When building production-grade applications, knowing that your database is ACID-compliant provides invaluable peace of mind. That’s because ACID-compliant transactions help ensure data reliability and integrity, providing a robust foundation for critical applications involving time-sensitive data and financial transactions. But what makes a database ACID-compliant?

# ACID Compliance Defined
[ACID compliance](https://www.timescale.com/learn/understanding-acid-compliance?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=linkedin-blogs-2025&utm_content=understanding-acid-compliance) refers to a core set of properties that ensure database transactions are processed reliably and consistently. The acronym stands for:
**Atomicity:**Transactions are indivisible; they either complete fully or not at all.**Consistency:**Transactions transition the database from one valid state to another.**Isolation:**Concurrent transactions do not affect each other’s operations.**Durability:**Once committed, transactions persist even in case of failure.
Let’s sprint through each.

# Four Pillars of ACID Compliance
## 1. Atomicity: The All-or-Nothing Rule
Atomicity ensures a transaction is treated as a single unit of work. If any part of it fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, preventing partial updates that could corrupt the database.

For example, consider an e-commerce application processing a payment and updating an inventory. If the payment succeeds but the inventory update fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring data consistency across the system.

## 2. Consistency: Maintaining Data Integrity
Consistency ensures that database rules and constraints are adhered to before and after a transaction. This property guarantees that the database remains in a valid state by enforcing referential integrity, unique constraints, and other rules.

If an operation violates a constraint, such as inserting a duplicate primary key, the transaction is aborted. This is crucial in financial applications, inventory management systems, or any scenario where data accuracy is non-negotiable.

## 3. Isolation: Preventing Transaction Interference
Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with one another. Without isolation, simultaneous transactions might read or write intermediate data, leading to inconsistencies like:

- Dirty Reads: Reading uncommitted data from other transactions.
- Non-Repeatable Reads: Different results in the same query within a transaction.
- Phantom Reads: New rows appearing due to other transactions.
## 4. Durability: Ensuring Data Persistence
Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains in the system even after a crash or power loss. This is achieved through persistent storage mechanisms that write committed changes to disk.

For example, in a financial system, once a transaction is marked successful, it must persist despite unexpected power failures, ensuring data reliability.

# Why ACID Compliance Matters for Modern Applications
[ACID compliance](https://www.timescale.com/learn/understanding-acid-compliance?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=linkedin-blogs-2025&utm_content=understanding-acid-compliance) is critical for microservices and distributed systems. It provides a solid foundation for building reliable applications, especially when dealing with:
- Financial transactions requiring absolute consistency
- High-frequency data ingestion needing transaction guarantees
- Multi-step operations that must succeed or fail as a unit
- Concurrent access from multiple users or services
For production systems at scale, ACID compliance mitigates data anomalies and ensures state consistency. By choosing an ACID-compliant database, you’re investing in data reliability and application correctness. Yet just because a database is performant doesn’t mean it’s ACID-compliant. Modern applications demand both — in one application database.

# Is PostgreSQL ACID-Compliant?
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/) is well-known for its ACID compliance, providing all four properties out of the box:
- Enforces atomicity using a robust rollback mechanism with transaction logs (Write-Ahead Logging- WAL) to revert any incomplete operations.
- Provides a strong set of integrity constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints, to uphold consistency.
- Prevents transaction interference issues by providing multiple isolation levels: Read Uncommitted (minimal isolation, allowing dirty reads); Read Committed (only committed data is read — default in PostgreSQL); Repeatable Read (ensures the same result for a repeated query); and Serializable (highest isolation level, preventing concurrency issues).
- Ensures durability by using WAL to record changes before they are applied to the actual database.
PostgreSQL’s full ACID compliance makes it a trusted database for mission-critical applications. Timescale, built on PostgreSQL, inherits its ACID properties while extending them to handle time-series data and real-time analytics efficiently. Whether you’re storing real-time IoT sensor readings, financial transactions, or application metrics, your data remains consistent and reliable — and your queries remain lightning-fast — with Timescale.
