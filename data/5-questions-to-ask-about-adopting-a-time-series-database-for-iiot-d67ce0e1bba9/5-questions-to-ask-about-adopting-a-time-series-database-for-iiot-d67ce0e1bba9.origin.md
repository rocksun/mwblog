# 5 Questions to Ask About Adopting a Time-Series Database for IIoT
For Industrial IoT (IIoT) developers, engineers, and managers weighing the possibility of adopting a time-series database, there are key considerations involved.

Modernizing industrial operations involves challenges, including the complexity of integrating legacy SCADA systems with modern IoT and cloud architectures, harnessing massive time-series data streams, achieving real-time operational visibility, and meeting rigorous compliance standards.

# Evaluating Your Industrial Data Management Needs
A reliable industry-ready database platform with an extensive plugin ecosystem and a low learning curve [can be transformative](https://www.timescale.com/learn/moving-past-legacy-systems-data-historian-vs-time-series-database?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=linkedin-blogs-2025&utm_content=data-historian-vs-time-series-database) — handling the dual demands of real-time operations and long-term analytics. Since each industrial use case has its requirements, your setup might involve a time-series database replacing (or integrating with) a data historian. Either way, here are five key questions to ask when considering the transition. These questions are by no means comprehensive — they simply provide a way to begin evaluating available options.

Some of the considerations involved in choosing a database for IIoT

## 1. How will a time-series database support existing OT systems?
If your industrial infrastructure relies on protocols like MQTT, Modbus, or OPC-UA for control systems communication, evaluate how the new system integrates with existing protocols. Consider how your historian integrates with PLCs, DCS, and SCADA systems and whether your architecture needs bidirectional communication with control systems. Additionally, verify if the time-series database can interface seamlessly with edge devices, enabling localized processing and reducing latency. This is critical in environments where downtime can lead to significant financial or operational losses.

## 2. What are your data retention and compliance requirements?
Industrial operations must maintain audit trails and meet specific regulatory requirements, so check your database choice for audit logging capabilities. Your time series solution needs to handle various data retention periods while meeting data sovereignty requirements. Historical data migration and backfill capabilities are important for maintaining operational continuity. Look for a solution that offers data management automation via scheduled policies for data retention and reordering. This capability is critical for production workloads to ensure efficient resource utilization and optimized query performance.

## 3. What are your query patterns and performance requirements?
Understanding your industrial application’s read/write patterns is essential for choosing the right IIoT database. Consider whether you need real-time analytics, historical analysis, or both. Ingest speed and query response times are main factors in making your architecture choices. Learn how the database manages indexing, partitioning, and compression, as these features can drastically improve performance in high-throughput environments. It’s also worth checking if the database supports user-defined functions as well as integrations that enhance and facilitate machine learning workflows

## 4. How will a time-series database improve the team’s workflow?
Though the adoption of a time-series database can involve a learning curve for your team, the right database fit delivers benefits that streamline operations and decision-making workflows and far outweigh the initial learning curve. These benefits include automating manual processes, better insights through real-time analytics, and streamlined alerting and notification systems that enable faster anomaly response. Prioritize solutions with substantial technical resources and user-friendly documentation to empower your team to leverage the new platform.

## 5. What’s your scalability trajectory?
As your IIoT system grows, your database must handle data growth, sensor network expansion, and multi-site deployments. It’s essential to understand the cost and infrastructure implications of scaling. Look for time-series solutions that offer vertical and horizontal scalability, enabling you to handle higher ingestion rates and to add capacity without rearchitecting your system. As you consider scalability, it’s also helpful to choose a time-series solution that scales cost-effectively while handling multiple data types, to avoid adding to your stack complexity.
