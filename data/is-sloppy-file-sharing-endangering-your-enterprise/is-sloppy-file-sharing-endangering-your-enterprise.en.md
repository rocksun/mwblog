Sharing digital data is one of the most important and riskiest parts of modern business. Multiple times a day, organizations transfer sensitive information — customer data, medical test results, financial information, code, sales reports — to internal and external partners. But without guardrails, this in-transit data is vulnerable to theft or loss.

Managed file transfer (MFT) solutions put guardrails in place. Other solutions — including secure file transfer protocol ([SFTP](https://thenewstack.io/create-a-secure-ftp-server-with-linux-and-ssh/)) and its predecessor, FTP; cloud storage services; and emailing attachments (please don’t) — have varying drawbacks, such as file size limitations, absence of encryption (potentially exposing data to leaks), inability to track or rescind data access, and lack of automation.

MFT solutions are pitched as a way to eliminate many of these problems. These technologies enable organizations to transfer files easily and reliably, even automating repetitive tasks to support efficient workflows. They can also integrate with other key enterprise applications, simplifying how organizations bring transferred data into logistics, customer, health care, financial and other data platforms. And as a business grows and its files grow larger, MFT can scale alongside it.

Most importantly, MFT allows companies to maintain [security](https://thenewstack.io/security/) and control over their sensitive data. Capabilities like data encryption, access control and secure file transfer help organizations protect confidential data and maintain regulatory compliance.
