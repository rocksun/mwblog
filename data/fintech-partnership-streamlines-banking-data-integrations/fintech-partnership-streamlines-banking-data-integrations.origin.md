SAN FRANCISCO — In the highly competitive sector of specialized financial IT, innovation is not just a market advantage, it’s a mandate.

For [Sandbox Banking](https://sandboxbanking.com/), a company at the intersection of integration and financial technology (fintech), this principle is embodied in its partnership with Docusign, the world’s market-leading digital document authentication provider. By playing a prominent role in Docusign’s [Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) marketplace and its ecosystem of applications](https://thenewstack.io/docusign-expands-its-developer-community-with-new-platform/), Sandbox Banking is helping define how financial institutions streamline operations and improve customer experience.

Sandbox Banking’s Glyue (pronounced “glue”) integration application provides financial institutions with a specific suite of tools that connects disparate systems and optimizes workflows by populating forms with previously verified customer information. Collaborating with Docusign to make Glyue available within Docusign’s developer console represents a significant step in getting the app into the hands of financial institutions that need this service 24/7. Sandbox co-founder and CEO [Ravi Balasubramanian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravibalasubramanian/) discussed the partnership with Docusign at the inaugural [Docusign Discover event](https://events.docusign.com/discover) in November.

## Partnership With Docusign
The Glyue app is a pivotal component within the Docusign Intelligent Agreement Management platform, particularly in its [Maestro workflow builder](https://www.docusign.com/products/platform/maestro). This partnership enables banks and credit unions to automate complex agreement workflows by seamlessly integrating core banking systems, customer relationship management (CRM) tools and loan origination systems (LOS).

Docusign Maestro is a tool that helps businesses automate and streamline their agreement processes. It essentially acts as an orchestrator, connecting different steps and systems involved in an agreement workflow.

“Glyue acts as the connective tissue between financial institutions’ various systems, facilitating the movement of data in and out of core banking platforms,” [Thomas Ngoy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-ngoy-0554b2265/), solution architect at Sandbox, told The New Stack. “By automating workflows such as updating customer profiles or managing agreements, we significantly reduce manual processes and improve operational efficiency.

“Let’s say a customer fills out a web form to change their address. With Glyue, the bank can automatically update this information in their core system, eliminating the need for manual data entry and reducing errors.”

## Empowering Financial Institutions
Sandbox Banking’s Glyue app offers financial institutions several important functions:

**Pre-built connectors:**Glyue’s extensive library of system adapters connects to core banking systems, CRMs, LOS platforms and call center software. This reduces the time and cost associated with building integrations from scratch.**Customization capabilities:**Institutions can tailor workflows to meet their unique operational needs. For example, a credit union can use Glyue to automate the process of updating customer contact information across multiple systems, eliminating manual data entry.**Scalable efficiency:**By integrating multiple systems through Glyue, financial institutions can create a networked infrastructure that ensures data consistency and synchronization across their entire technology stack.
## The Role of AI and Automation
Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to further transform the integration landscape, and Sandbox Banking is actively exploring ways to incorporate it into its offerings.

“We’re on the brink of enabling non-programmers to build integrations with minimal effort,” [Skye Isard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skyeisard/), Sandbox Banking co-founder and CTO, told The New Stack. “AI-driven tools can automate the creation of logic for integrations, seriously reducing the complexity and time required to deploy new workflows.

“AI is empowering [‘citizen developers](https://thenewstack.io/citizen-integrators-myth-or-aspiration-for-it-teams/)‘ — individuals without coding expertise — to create automations and integrations, further democratizing access to technology. AI allows us to leverage our vast library of API documentation and prebuilt integrations to create even more intelligent and automated solutions. We envision a future where AI can generate integration logic, making it easier for non-programmers to build and deploy integrations.”

The company’s focus on using AI aligns with broader industry trends. As financial institutions face mounting pressure to innovate, tools such as Glyue — combined with AI — will play an essential role in enabling agility and scalability. AI learns users’ tendencies, stores them away and brings them out when needed in a transaction — all without human action.

## Security and Compliance
Given the sensitive nature of banking data, Sandbox Banking prioritizes security, Isard said. Its platform adheres to stringent compliance standards, including SOC2 audits, recurring penetration testing and advanced encryption protocols. Data persistence is minimized, with live databases retaining sensitive information for no more than 14 days.

These measures ensure that Sandbox Banking’s solutions not only improve efficiency but also meet high standards of data protection and privacy, Isard said.

“The future of fintech lies in seamless integration,” Ngoy said. “By combining Docusign’s IAM [Intelligent Agreement Management] platform with Sandbox Banking’s Glyue, we’re enabling financial institutions to unlock the full potential of their IT ecosystems.”

In an industry where time is money and precision is expected in every transaction, Sandbox Banking’s solutions are proving to be indispensable for many businesses. As AI and intelligent automation continue to reshape the sector, its partnership with Docusign stands as a testament to what’s possible when innovation meets execution.
