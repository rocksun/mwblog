[Observability](https://thenewstack.io/observability/) has rapidly become a cornerstone of modern engineering strategies, though its definition has been hotly debated recently.
With its roots in control systems theory, observability was popularized by the Honeycomb team in 2016. They expanded upon Rudolf E. Kálmán’s definition — “a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs.” — and redefined it to mean “the power to ask new questions of your system, without having to ship new code or gather new data to ask those new questions.”

Observability soon gained traction in application performance monitoring (APM) tooling, especially following [Peter Bourgon’s 2017 blog post](https://peter.bourgon.org/blog/2017/02/21/metrics-tracing-and-logging.html), which suggested that observability consists of “three pillars”: metrics, logs, and traces. The framework aligned closely with APM products, quickly becoming the industry standard.

Yet, this model limited observability’s potential compared to its original meaning.

Indeed, observability extends beyond traditional monitoring and data gathering; it’s about unveiling system behaviors, empowering teams to reveal “unknown unknowns,” and completely understanding complex systems.

Observability 2.0 represents a step toward fulfilling the original promise of this term, giving developers and decision-makers real-time, actionable insights about their systems.

In this post, I’ll explore the evolution of observability and its implications for developer happiness, productivity, and the day-to-day experience.

**Observability 1.0 vs. Observability 2.0 **
Given how new Observability 2.0 is — officially coined by Charity Majors only this summer — let’s clarify the difference between the two versions.

**Observability 1.0 **
Observability 1.0, closely tied to APM tools, refers to the traditional approach where vast amounts of telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) are collected and then displayed with dashboards — or the often aspired-to “Single pane of glass.”

Observability 1.0 focuses on operations at its core: it highlights known issues once the software is in production. It’s helpful if you already know what to look for — the “known unknown”— but it requires manual exploration to find the root cause of an issue.

As a result, developers don’t like relying on APM tools for things like debugging because they give you a [large volume of aggregate data](https://thenewstack.io/the-rise-of-community-driven-data-analysis-in-the-age-of-ai/) instead of the specific information you need to solve the problem. They often feel like they’re searching for a needle in a haystack.

While helpful for managing distributed systems, Observability 1.0 doesn’t fully address developers’ day-to-day challenges or aid them in proactively understanding their systems.

**Observability 2.0 **
Observability 2.0 represents a shift in focus beyond simply identifying operational issues to empowering developers throughout the entire software development lifecycle. It’s the acknowledgment that our definition of “observability” is evolving — or better yet — finally meeting the promise of its original definition.

While Observability 1.0 emphasizes identifying fires and monitoring system health, observability 2.0 is more developer-focused. It’s about addressing the root causes of issues and reducing incident frequency by embedding observability into the development process itself — in other words, solving problems before they appear on the observability 1.0 dashboards!

The two main problems Observability 2.0 addresses for developers are:

- They need precise, real-time, context-rich insights into their system so they can depend on a single source of truth to understand unknown unknowns.
- Faster debugging, where developers can easily introspect or understand complex systems.
This is possible because the building block of observability 2.0 is log events, which are more powerful, practical, and cost-effective than metrics (the workhorse of observability 1.0), as they preserve context and relationships between data.

Furthermore, observability 2.0 is built on open standards like OpenTelemetry, which allows devs to use a common standard for traces, logs, and metrics.

**How Observability 2.0 Will Change the Developer Experience **
Developer Experience (DX) shapes how engineers perceive their work, impacting productivity, engagement, happiness, and retention. A strong DX fosters an environment where teams can perform at their best, tackling challenges efficiently and enthusiastically.

The latest Stack Overflow Survey revealed that technical debt remains the top frustration for developers. It often leads to demoralizing [work as developers struggle to fix bugs without major system](https://thenewstack.io/putting-ai-to-work-systems-of-intelligence-and-actionable-agency/) refactoring. Add to this the drain caused by complex systems, poor documentation, and insufficient debugging tools, and it’s easy to see how 8+ hours a week can be lost to inefficiencies.

This directly impacts DX, hindering teams’ ability to deliver reliable, scalable, and maintainable software. Research has identified three core areas for improving DX:

**Feedback Loops**: Enable continuous improvement through rapid learning and adjustments.**Cognitive Load Management**: Provide accurate, accessible documentation.**Optimal Flow State**: Minimize disruptions to maintain deep work.
Observability 2.0 addresses these areas by empowering developers with increased visibility and reduced manual tasks:

**Real-Time, Context-Rich Insights**:[Developers gain immediate feedback on system changes](https://thenewstack.io/does-cloud-native-change-developer-productivity-and-experience/), helping them ship code faster and more confidently. Observability 2.0 makes uncovering the system design, architecture, and dependencies less like an archaeological dig, offering clear visibility into all components and their relationships.**Reduced Manual Work**: Using observability frameworks like OpenTelemetry for documentation means your running system stays consistent with your documentation without making manual updates. Debugging also becomes more efficient with context-rich data, allowing developers to diagnose issues without sifting through overwhelming volumes of data.
**Practical Example: Debugging with Observability 2.0 **
Observability 2.0 opens the doors for new use cases and tools to solve developers’ daily problems and save them significant time and headaches.

Let’s examine the debugging process and how it evolves with observability 2.0.

Traditional debugging involves a search-first approach: developers sift through telemetry data, search through endless logs and traces, pattern match using intuition, and rely on experience, educated guesses, and a (possibly outdated) mental model of the system.

They attempt to reproduce the issue, although that might not always be possible due to vague and incomplete reports — if any details are provided at all.

Lastly, they may also have to navigate across scattered resources — documentation, architecture diagrams, decision records, APIs, and repos — just to comprehensively understand the system.

Issues are rarely isolated in complex, distributed systems. Understanding not just **what **went wrong but also **why **and **how **something went wrong requires correlating data across various system layers, which is time-consuming and prone to human error.

Not to mention that sometimes teams are pressured to “just fix the problem as fast as possible” because of business needs and deadlines. With observability 1.0, this may result in addressing the “symptoms” of an issue but not the actual core problems.

With Observability 2.0, new developer tools like Multiplayer.app, leveraging OpenTelemetry, allow for platform-level debugging with deep session replays. In one click, developers can capture sessions showing steps to reproduce a bug, accompanied by [data from frontend screens to deep platform traces](https://thenewstack.io/the-benefits-of-bringing-together-debugging-and-tracing-data/), metrics, and logs.

By mapping real-time data onto the entire system architecture, developers gain a clear, context-rich view from high-level designs to individual components and dependencies — drastically reducing time spent on troubleshooting.

**Conclusion **
The evolution of observability reflects the growing complexity of modern software systems and the need for more sophisticated tools to manage and understand them.

By leveraging observability 2.0 and frameworks like OpenTelemetry, organizations can develop a holistic, real-time view of their software, [improving the developer experience](https://thenewstack.io/improving-developer-experience-drives-profitability/) and boosting overall productivity and long-term sustainability.

They are no longer just addressing “symptoms” — like constantly taking painkillers because you have headaches — but addressing the root problem and preventing the headache before it forms.

Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, observability will continue to drive advancements in software reliability, scalability, and maintainability — ultimately saving organizations time, money, and engineering effort.

In the future, we can expect observability 2.0 to further fuel developer teams by automating complex troubleshooting processes, enabling rapid onboarding, and reducing knowledge silos. Observability will continue evolving, addressing the full spectrum of [software development and operational](https://thenewstack.io/software-composition-analysis-and-sboms-a-united-defense/) challenges, leading to more efficient, cost-effective, and resilient engineering organizations.
