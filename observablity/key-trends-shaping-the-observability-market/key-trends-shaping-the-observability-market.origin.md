The [observability](https://thenewstack.io/observability/) market is undergoing significant transformation, driven by new technologies and changing demands. Here are four key trends that will significantly influence this market:

**1. The AI Revolution: LLMs and Observability**
Artificial intelligence and [large language models (LLMs)](https://roadmap.sh/guides/introduction-to-llms) are changing the way we monitor systems. Cloud native systems generate a lot of data, and AI helps uncover hidden insights and fix issues automatically. It can detect anomalies and adjust settings like CPU usage to avoid downtime. Additionally, LLMs make it easier to understand technical issues by explaining them in plain language.

Conversely, LLMs and [generative AI](https://thenewstack.io/ai/) also need strong observability to perform well. There are three key areas where LLMs benefit from observability tools:

**Resource management**: LLMs can be highly resource-intensive, requiring substantial computational power and memory. Observability tools track these resources to optimize deployment and control costs. For instance, tracking fluctuations in an LLM’s CPU and memory usage can prevent unexpected cost spikes by enabling timely adjustments.**Performance monitoring**: LLMs can generate inaccurate results, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Implementing end-to-end tracing lets you track a request’s life cycle from submission to response, helping you identify where inaccuracies occur. Observability can also monitor how often responses need to be regenerated or assess user satisfaction with the outputs as an indicator of performance issues.**Model drift detection**: Observability tools can spot when an LLM’s performance deviates from expected norms by monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs). Significant deviations from historical data can trigger alerts, prompting engineers to recalibrate the models and maintain their effectiveness.
## 2. Unified Data Lakes
Traditionally, observability was all about monitoring metrics and analyzing logs. Metrics give a high-level view of system performance, like response times and error rates. Logs provide detailed information about events and errors, which are crucial for troubleshooting specific issues.

However, today’s organizations need more comprehensive insights, leading to the surge of observability data lakes. The following factors are driving this shift:

**Distributed tracing is a must-have**: As microservices become more common, tracing is essential for tracking how transactions move through the system.[Traces help pinpoint request flows and bottlenecks in distributed](https://thenewstack.io/demystifying-distributed-traces-in-opentelemetry/)systems, which requires more advanced data analysis, including dependency maps and performance metrics across various factors such as time, location and service ID. Observability data lakes offer integrated data graphs for a clear view of system performance and its performance bottlenecks.**Simplifying root cause analysis**: Instead of manually analyzing separate data streams to find the root cause of an issue, a data lake combines metrics, logs and traces into a single view. This makes it easier to see not just what went wrong but also why, allowing for quicker and more effective investigation and troubleshooting.**Emerging data streams**: As new observability data streams like real user monitoring, continuous profiling and security observability emerge, data lakes become even more important. They integrate these insights, providing a complete view of application performance.**Unifying operations**: Additionally, data lakes unify observability across different operational areas, such as DevOps, ITOps, DataOps, FinOps, AIOps and LLM Ops. By combining data in one place, organizations can reduce their resources, compute costs and improve reliability across all systems.
**3. The Rise of OpenTelemetry (Otel)**
[OpenTelemetry (Otel) is gaining traction](https://thenewstack.io/opentelemetry-gaining-traction-from-companies-and-vendors/) as a response to vendor lock-in, siloed observability approaches and the need for standardization. According to the [latest Cloud Native Computing Foundation report](https://www.cncf.io/reports/opentelemetry-project-journey-report/), 1,106 companies and 9,168 individuals are contributing to its development. As an open source project driven by community innovation, [Otel provides a unified framework](https://www.kloudfuse.com/blog/understanding-opentelemetry) for [monitoring various systems and applications](https://thenewstack.io/why-upgrade-to-observability-from-application-monitoring/), making it easier to integrate observability across different platforms.
Otel’s growing adoption is due to its compatibility with a wide range of technologies, particularly those that benefit from its auto-instrumentation, such as [Java](https://thenewstack.io/oracle-unveils-java-23-simplicity-meets-enterprise-power/) and [Python](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-python/) applications. This flexibility helps organizations avoid being tied to a single vendor and allows them to tailor their observability solutions to their specific needs. As observability requirements evolve, Otel is likely to play an even bigger role in driving innovation and ensuring interoperability.

**4. Controlling Costs With Private Deployments**
As observability data volumes increase, costs are rising sharply, with some companies facing [multimillion-dollar bills](https://thenewstack.io/datadogs-65m-bill-and-why-developers-should-care/). Besides paying for overages, companies also pay for transferring their data into SaaS observability products. Traditional SaaS pricing models can’t keep up, leading many organizations to seek alternative solutions.

A growing trend is moving observability solutions to private clouds. This shift gives companies better control over their data and expenses. Private cloud solutions can be customized to fit specific needs and budgets, lowering overall observability costs.

**Conclusion**
The observability market is at a pivotal moment, shaped by advancements in AI as well as increasing data complexity and volume, and dominated by open source solutions like OpenTelemetry and the new approaches to managing observability costs. As these trends continue to develop, they will redefine how organizations monitor, manage and optimize their digital environments. Staying ahead in this dynamic landscape requires adapting to these changes and leveraging new tools and strategies to maintain efficiency and effectiveness in observability.
