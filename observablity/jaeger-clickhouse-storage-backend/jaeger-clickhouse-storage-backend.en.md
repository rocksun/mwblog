As someone who’s been maintaining [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), I’ve watched users request [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) support consistently over the past few years. With Jaeger v2.18.0, we’ve finally delivered it. What excites me most isn’t just that ClickHouse is available—it’s that its architecture is practically custom-built for telemetry at scale. It swallows massive, append-only write streams and handles complex analytical aggregations in milliseconds, offering teams a highly efficient, production-grade storage backend.

For those new to the project, Jaeger is a graduated Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) [distributed tracing](https://thenewstack.io/distributed-tracing-sampling-opentelemetry/) platform built to monitor and troubleshoot complex microservices. It tracks requests across service boundaries to expose latency bottlenecks and root causes, ultimately reducing a team’s mean time to repair (MTTR). By natively integrating ClickHouse, Jaeger can now leverage columnar storage to deliver blazing-fast query performance and high-ratio data compression for billions of spans.

In this post, I’ll explain why [ClickHouse](https://thenewstack.io/vector-search-without-the-lock-in-why-devs-like-clickhouse/) is a strong choice for storing traces, how the schema is designed under the hood, and how you can start using it with Jaeger today.

## Why columnar storage wins

At its core, the tracing problem is twofold: storing massive volumes of semi-structured event data and then searching that data quickly across multiple dimensions—service, operation, tags, duration, time range, and trace ID. Cassandra and Elasticsearch have served the Jaeger community well, but they come with operational costs. Indexing overhead adds latency and expense. Scaling becomes complex. Retention decisions force painful tradeoffs.

### High-throughput ingest and low-latency queries

ClickHouse is a column-oriented [OLAP database](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-run-olap-and-oltp-together-without-resource-contention/) designed for exactly these constraints: high-throughput ingestion, aggressive compression, and fast analytical queries. For tracing, this is nearly ideal. Trace data is repetitive by nature—the same service names, operation names, status codes, and tags appear over and over. A columnar layout thrives on that repetition.

### Compression that actually matters

We measured significant compression gains on trace data. Service names like “auth-service” or “payment-gateway” appear hundreds of thousands of times. Same with operation names, tag keys, and status codes. In a row-oriented database, that redundancy goes uncompressed. In a column-oriented one, ClickHouse groups identical values, making them trivial to compress. The result? An 8.6× compression ratio on the spans table in our benchmarks.

### Real-time analytics

ClickHouse also opens the door to more complex analytical queries on trace data. Because aggregations are highly efficient on columnar storage, Jaeger v2.18 includes native ClickHouse SPM methods to directly compute service-level latency, call rates, and error rates from your stored spans. This allows teams to generate core health and performance metrics for their microservices straight from their trace data, without needing an external metrics pipeline.

## Designing the schema

Schema design was where things got tricky. We needed to optimize for Jaeger’s core query patterns: trace lookup by trace ID, service, and operation; attribute filtering; time-range queries; and the aggregation powering the [Service Performance Monitoring (SPM)](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/2.17/architecture/spm/) feature. These constraints don’t all pull in the same direction.

There’s an excellent earlier [post](https://medium.com/jaegertracing/making-design-decisions-for-clickhouse-as-a-core-storage-backend-in-jaeger-62bf90a979d) by Ha Anh Vu that benchmarked ClickHouse schemas for Jaeger v1, and that work laid the foundation. However, Jaeger v2 adopts the OpenTelemetry data model, which forces us to revisit several decisions.

The design space is documented in detail in an [Architectural Decision Record (ADR)](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/v2.18.0/docs/adr/008-clickhouse-storage-schema.md). The sections below walk through some of the key decisions worth understanding.

### Trade-offs in primary key

In ClickHouse, the primary key isn’t a uniqueness constraint. Instead, it defines the on-disk sort order and powers a sparse index (one index per 8,192-row granule). Picking it is the single highest-leverage decision in the schema.

We had two candidates for choosing a primary key:

1. **Optimize for trace retrieval:** sort by trace\_id. Every span of a trace lands in one contiguous block, so GetTrace is a single seek + sequential read. However, search queries pay for this optimization, as the service\_name and operation\_name filters cannot use the primary key index at all.
2. **Optimize for search (chosen):** sort by (service\_name, name, start\_time). Search queries that filter by service, operation, and a time window become direct primary-key lookups.

The decision came down to an asymmetric trade-off. Sorting by trace\_id makes search performance terrible, but sorting by (service\_name, name, start\_time) hurts trace retrieval much less, because we can recover most of the lost performance with two cheap mechanisms:

1. A bloom\_filter skip index on trace\_id, which lets the engine prove a granule can’t contain a given ID without reading it.
2. A trace\_id\_timestamps materialized view that tells the search path each matching trace’s time bounds, so the follow-up GetTraces call can prune partitions and granules.

An earlier benchmark run with the schema sorted by trace\_id clearly showed the asymmetry. Trace retrieval was about 27 ms, but a search query took about 880 ms. Re-sorting by (`service_name`, `name`, `start_time`) pushed trace retrieval to around 100 ms (slower, but still well under interactive thresholds) while bringing multi-filter search down to about 140 ms.

### Storing typed attributes

In Jaeger v1, tags were always strings. The v2 reader API accepts a typed map, where attributes can be Bool, Int64, Float64, String, or one of the complex types (Bytes, Slice, Map). We need to query across these types, so the storage layer can’t collapse everything to strings.

The schema leverages ClickHouse’s [Nested](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/data-types/nested-data-structures/nested) column per primitive type, repeated at the span, event, link, resource, and scope level. Think of it as a mini table inside each row; each can have its own set of attribute names and values. This approach lets attribute filters use the same query semantics as querying a regular table.

However, it is worth noting that Attribute-only searches are inherently more expensive because they cannot fully leverage ClickHouse’s primary index. The table’s index is optimized around top-level structural fields—specifically `service`, `operation`, and `time`. For optimal query performance and to prevent heavy column scans, users should always combine attribute filters with these fields to limit the data ClickHouse has to scan.

### Materialized views

Some of Jaeger’s queries don’t fit the spans table’s sort order. For example, the Jaeger UI needs to quickly load the full list of known service names and operations, while trace searches often need efficient access to trace time ranges.

Rather than answering these with expensive table scans, we use materialized views to precompute the data. In ClickHouse, [materialized views](https://clickhouse.com/docs/materialized-view/incremental-materialized-view) automatically transform inserts into a source table and write the results into optimized target tables.

This approach is used to speed up queries for service names, operations, and trace ID timestamp ranges.

### Five levels of attributes

A technical challenge that may not be immediately obvious from the span’s schema: how the storage layer interprets attribute lookups. For instance, when searching for http.status\_code=200, the system cannot inherently distinguish if “200” is a string, an integer, a span-level attribute, or a resource-level attribute. Depending on the service, the same logical key could be categorized under `str_attributes` or `int_attributes`, and it might exist at any of the five data levels: resource, scope, span, event, or link.

To solve this, we maintain a dedicated [attribute\_metadata](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/v2.18.0/internal/storage/v2/clickhouse/sql/create_attribute_metadata_table.sql) table, populated by materialized views off the spans table. This allows the reader to look up the filter key at query time and only query the columns for the types and levels that were observed.

## Span throughput at scale

We benchmarked the ClickHouse backend using 10 million spans across 1 million traces on a single-node deployment. The benchmark measured ingestion throughput, compression, trace retrieval, and filtered search latency.

The backend sustained more than 50k spans/sec during ingestion, achieved an 8.6× compression ratio on the spans table, and reduced span data by nearly 6 GiB to roughly 722 MiB on disk. Trace retrieval averaged around 100 ms, while most search queries stayed under 50 ms. More complex filtered queries completed in about 140 ms.

> “The backend sustained more than 50k spans/sec during ingestion, achieved an 8.6× compression ratio on the spans table, and reduced span data by nearly 6 GiB to roughly 722 MiB on disk.”

These numbers are encouraging, but they should be read in the context of the benchmark environment and dataset. Full methodology, configuration, and query details are available in the [benchmarking report](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/main/internal/storage/v2/clickhouse/BENCHMARKING.md).

### Getting started

ClickHouse support is available in alpha as a storage backend starting with Jaeger v2.18.0. You’ll need a running ClickHouse instance and the Jaeger v2 configuration for the ClickHouse backend. The full instructions are described in the [setup guide](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/2.18/storage/clickhouse/).
