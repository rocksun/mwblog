The future of observability isn't just about dashboards and alerts‚Äîit's about **conversational operations**. Today, we're excited to introduce the **OneUptime MCP Server**, a production-ready implementation of the Model Context Protocol that brings AI-native observability to your development workflow.

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to external systems and services. Think of it as a bridge between AI models and real-world tools‚Äîallowing AI assistants to take actions, query data, and automate complex workflows on your behalf.

With MCP, instead of copy-pasting error logs into ChatGPT or manually creating incident reports, you can simply ask your AI assistant to:

* "Check the status of our production API monitors"
* "Create a critical incident for the database outage"
* "Show me error logs from the last hour"

## Why OneUptime + MCP = Game Changer

As an **open source observability platform**, OneUptime's integration with MCP represents a fundamental shift toward **AI-first operations**:

### **ü§ñ Natural Language Operations**

Replace complex CLI commands and dashboard navigation with simple conversations:

```
Human: "Are there any incidents in our production project right now?"

AI: Let me check your OneUptime incidents...
[Queries OneUptime via MCP]
I found 2 open incidents in your production project:
- Critical: Database connection timeout (started 15 minutes ago)
- Warning: High memory usage on web servers (started 2 hours ago)

Would you like me to get more details or take any actions?
```

### **üåä Workflow Automation**

Chain multiple operations together through natural conversation:

```
Human: "Something's wrong with our checkout service"

AI: I
1. Check monitors for the checkout service
2. Look for recent incidents
3. Query error logs from the last 30 minutes
4. Create an incident if needed

[Executes multiple MCP calls]

I found elevated error rates and created incident #INC-2024-001 
"Checkout Service Degradation" with high severity. The incident 
has been assigned to the on-call engineer.
```

## Comprehensive OneUptime Integration

The MCP server provides **complete access** to OneUptime's functionality through AI conversations:

### **üìä Monitoring & Alerts**

* **Monitor Management**: Create, update, and query monitors across all types
* **Alert Operations**: Acknowledge, resolve, and escalate alerts
* **Status Checking**: Real-time status of services and infrastructure
* **Probe Management**: Configure and monitor global probe locations

```
AI Tools Available:
- oneuptime_create_monitor
- oneuptime_list_onitors  
- oneuptime_get_monitor
- oneuptime_update_monitor
- oneuptime_delete_monitor
- oneuptime_count_monitors
```

### **üö® Incident Management**

* **Incident Lifecycle**: Create, update, and resolve incidents
* **Team Coordination**: Assign incidents and manage escalations
* **Communication**: Add notes, updates, and status changes
* **Post-Mortems**: Document resolution and lessons learned

```
Example Conversation:
Human: "Create a critical incident for our API being down"

AI: I

[Creates incident via MCP]

‚úÖ Created incident INC-2024-001 "API Service Outage"
- Severity: Critical
- Status: Created
- Assigned to: On-call team
- Created: 2024-07-01 14:30 UTC

The incident has been automatically escalated to your on-call policy.
```

### **üìà Log Analysis & Metrics**

* **Log Querying**: Search and filter logs with natural language
* **Metric Analysis**: Query performance data and trends
* **Trace Investigation**: Analyze distributed traces and spans
* **Error Investigation**: Deep-dive into exceptions and errors

```
Human: "Show me all error logs from the checkout service in the last hour"

AI: [Queries logs via MCP]
Found 47 error logs from checkout service in the last hour:

Top errors:
- Database timeout (23 occurrences)
- Payment gateway 503 (12 occurrences)  
- Redis connection failed (8 occurrences)
- Session validation error (4 occurrences)

Would you like me to create an incident or investigate any specific error?
```

### **üë• Team & Project Management**

* **User Management**: Add, update, and manage team members
* **Permission Control**: Configure roles and access levels
* **Project Organization**: Manage multiple projects and environments
* **On-Call Scheduling**: Update schedules and handle overrides

## Real-World Use Cases

### **1. Intelligent Incident Response**

```
Human: "Our customers are reporting the website is slow"

AI: Let me investigate this issue for you:

1. Checking website monitors... ‚úÖ
   - Response time: 2.3s (normal: 0.8s)
   - Availability: 98.2% (down 1.8%)

2. Looking for related incidents... ‚úÖ
   - Found 1 similar incident from last month

3. Querying recent logs... ‚úÖ
   - High database query times detected
   - Memory usage at 89% on web servers

4. Creating incident... ‚úÖ
   - Created INC-2024-002 "Website Performance Degradation"
   - Assigned to platform team
   - Added investigation findings

Recommended actions:
- Scale web servers
- Investigate database performance
- Monitor response times closely
```

### **2. Proactive Monitoring Setup**

```
Human: "We're launching a new microservice called 'user-auth' at https://api.example.com/auth/health. Can you set up monitoring for it?"

AI: I

1. Creating health check monitor... ‚úÖ
2. Setting up performance monitoring... ‚úÖ
3. Configuring error rate alerts... ‚úÖ
4. Adding to production status page... ‚úÖ

Your user-auth service is now fully monitored with:
- Health endpoint checks every 30 seconds
- Response time alerts if > 2 seconds
- Error rate alerts if > 5%
- Automatic incident creation for failures

The service is also visible on your public status page.
```

### **3. Operational Reporting**

```
Human: "Give me a summary of our infrastructure health this week"

AI: Here's your infrastructure health summary for this week:

üìä **Monitors**: 47 active (2 new this week)
- Uptime: 99.8% average
- Response time: 0.7s average
- 3 brief outages (total: 14 minutes)

üö® **Incidents**: 8 total (5 resolved, 3 ongoing)
- Critical: 1 (database issue - resolved)
- High: 2 (API rate limiting - ongoing)
- Medium: 5 (minor performance issues)

üìà **Performance Trends**:
- Database queries 15% slower than last week
- Error rates down 8% overall
- Memory usage increased 12%

üîß **Recommendations**:
- Consider database optimization
- Monitor memory usage trends
- Review API rate limiting strategy
```
