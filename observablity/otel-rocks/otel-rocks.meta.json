But what\u2019s the reality for those who use it daily? We sat down with several engineers and SREs to get their unfiltered thoughts on OTel. The result? A candid conversation about the good, the bad, and the sometimes frustrating aspects of working with OTel. In preparation for the KubeCon talk OTel Sucks (But Also Rocks!), Juraci spoke with community members and gathered a wealth of valuable insights. Due to time constraints, not all the material could be included in the presentation, so this is an attempt to do justice to the community\u2019s contributions.", "sitename": "OpenTelemetry", "date": "2025-04-03", "categories": ["blog"], "tags": [], "fingerprint": null, "id": null, "license": "CC BY 4.0", "body": null, "comments": null, "commentsbody": null, "raw_text": null, "text": null, "language": null, "image": "https://opentelemetry.io/img/social/logo-wordmark-001.png", "pagetype": "article", "filedate": "2025-04-09", "cntitle": "OTel \u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5f88\u884c\uff01", "cndescription": "OpenTelemetry\uff08OTel\uff09\u7ecf\u5e38\u88ab\u5439\u6367\u4e3a\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u627f\u8bfa\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u4e2d\u7acb\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3002\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u6bcf\u5929\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u7684\u4eba\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u60c5\u51b5\u662f\u600e\u6837\u7684\u5462\uff1f\u6211\u4eec\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f4d\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u548c\u7ad9\u70b9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff08SRE\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9 OTel \u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u60f3\u6cd5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u573a\u5766\u8bda\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u6d89\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528 OTel \u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u3001\u7f3a\u70b9\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u65f6\u4ee4\u4eba\u6cae\u4e27\u7684\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u5728\u51c6\u5907 KubeCon \u7684\u6f14\u8bb2 OTel Sucks (But Also Rocks!) \u65f6\uff0cJuraci \u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u6210\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u975e\u6240\u6709\u6750\u6599\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5305\u542b\u5728\u6f14\u793a\u6587\u7a3f\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u672c\u6587\u8bd5\u56fe\u516c\u6b63\u5730\u5448\u73b0\u793e\u533a\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}
