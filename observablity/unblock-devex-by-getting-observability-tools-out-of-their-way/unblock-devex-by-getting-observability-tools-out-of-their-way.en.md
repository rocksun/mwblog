Software developers’ relationship with their tools is, to say the least, complicated. When tools work well, they fade into the background, enabling flow, creativity and speed. They simplify the complex, automate the tedious and help teams deliver better code faster.

But all too often, developer “solutions” are anything but. Many tools are difficult to set up, poorly integrated with existing workflows and overloaded with features that create friction instead of focus. The result? More time spent fighting the tool than solving the problem.

For developers, this translates into lower productivity, increased frustration and greater risk of burnout. The more fragmented and complex the toolchain becomes, the harder it is to stay in flow and the further developers drift from what they love most: building great software.

> Observability tools should meet developers where they work, so they can stay in flow and spend less time debugging and more time building.

The developer experience for [observability](https://thenewstack.io/observability/) shouldn’t be dictated by tool vendors. It should be shaped by developers themselves; built on the principles of simplicity, automation and integration. The best tools are the ones that *get out of the way* and empower developers to move faster, with confidence.

Observability tools should meet developers where they work, so they can stay in flow and spend less time debugging and more time building.

Solutions that prioritize developer experience by integrating seamlessly into IDEs, [CI/CD](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-ci-cd/) pipelines and [platform workflows](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/) keep developers in the flow, minimize context switching and enable efficient debugging, monitoring and scaling across environments.

## Shifting the Observability Narrative to DevEx

If you’re spending more time chasing issues and less time innovating, join us on Nov. 6 at 11 a.m. PT | 2 p.m. ET for a special online event, [From Friction to Flow: Shifting How Developers Leverage Observability](https://thenewstack.io/webinar/from-friction-to-flow-shifting-how-developers-leverage-observability/).

During this free webinar, Principal Developer Advocate [Jeff Blankenburg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffblankenburg/) and Principal PPM [Sean O’Dell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theseanodell/) from Dynatrace will join TNS Host [Chris Pirillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrispirillo/) to explore how observability transforms the developer experience from friction-filled to flow-driven.

## Register for This Free Webinar Today!

If you can’t join us live, register anyway, and we’ll send you a recording following the webinar.

## What You’ll Learn

By attending this special online event, you’ll leave with best practices, real-world examples and actionable tips, including:
