The digital transformation wave is bringing a surge of high-velocity technologies, each with its monitoring tools. This has led to a proliferation of tools within IT and Security environments, creating a complex web of systems that are difficult to manage and often overlap in functionality. This “tool sprawl” is a growing concern for businesses, as it can lead to inefficiencies, increased costs, and even security problems.

Imagine teams juggling multiple monitoring tools, each providing a fragmented view of their IT infrastructure. Troubleshooting becomes a nightmare as teams sift through disparate dashboards, struggling to correlate data and pinpoint the root cause of problems. This wastes valuable time and resources and hinders the organization’s ability to respond quickly to incidents.

So, how are businesses tackling this problem? They’re increasingly turning to tool consolidation as a solution. By streamlining their monitoring stack and cutting back on the number of tools in use, they can gain a unified view of their IT environment, improve efficiency, and reduce costs. However, it takes work, as contextualizing tool consolidation requires careful planning and execution, including a thorough assessment of existing tools, clear communication with stakeholders, and a phased approach to implementation.

## Benefits of Consolidating the Monitoring Stack
With a unified view of your systems, you can quickly identify and resolve issues before they impact your business. Reducing sprawl by adopting multipurpose unified monitoring can also bootstrap productivity, increase efficiency gains, and prevent downtime.

A single unified monitoring [platform provides your teams](https://thenewstack.io/a-platform-team-product-manager-determines-devops-success/) with the capabilities of a shared framework for visualizing, alerting, and collaborating on issues and a single point for integrating advanced security and observability tools. This helps reduce costs and optimize resources for offensive and defensive security strategies.

With a consolidated monitoring stack, your teams can better understand your security posture and identify vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them at scale. Interestingly, service owners (developers, admins, security, etc.) can get a clear picture of what’s happening across your entire IT landscape, allowing everyone to be on the same page to proactively address potential problems and optimize inefficiencies in your security operations.

## Overcome Barriers With Risk Assessment
Consolidating your monitoring tools can disrupt your IT services if not planned and executed carefully. You’d need to develop a comprehensive migration plan with thorough testing and clear communication with stakeholders.

Consider a security incident that’s affecting your customers. In most cases, teams don’t have a centralized place to capture incident context, which leads to context switching as they chase information across multiple systems. This undifferentiated heavy lifting adds critical time to the process and erodes customer trust in more significant incidents.

A good starting point is calculating the time these disparate solutions added to incident resolution. Multiply this by the number of incidents over the last six months and determine the team costs. You can have practical conversations with decision-makers to drive change and streamline incident response processes by highlighting these costs and showing the impact on the business and customers.

One of the primary risks is dependency on specific tools or vendors. Before consolidating, you should thoroughly evaluate the dependencies between your existing tools and IT infrastructure. Ensuring that your chosen consolidated solution can effectively accommodate these dependencies is essential.

Another risk factor is vendor lock-in. While having a single platform can simplify your monitoring stack, it might create a strong dependency on that vendor. It would serve well to adopt open-source [solutions or choose vendors with flexible and open APIs](https://thenewstack.io/the-power-of-k8s-api-solutions-revolutionizing-industries/), allowing easier integration with other tools.

## Creating Your Consolidation Strategy
You need a big picture of your current monitoring stack. This means thoroughly auditing all the tools used across your IT and security environments. You’d want to focus on everything, including niche tools that specific teams or applications rely on. For each tool, document its core functionalities, strengths, and weaknesses. This will help you understand what capabilities you need to keep and where there might be room for improvement or consolidation.

Once you understand your existing toolset, map those capabilities to your organization’s specific monitoring needs. This involves clearly defining your requirements for performance monitoring, security monitoring, and compliance. And by comparing your existing tool capabilities to your defined needs, you can identify any gaps in functionality or areas where tools overlap. This mapping exercise will tremendously help you prioritize the most critical capabilities as you consolidate.

But technology is only part of the equation. Your team’s skills and expertise are just as crucial. Take the time to assess their current skill sets and identify any knowledge gaps related to different monitoring tools and technologies. Based on this assessment, you can develop a training plan to equip your team with the necessary skills to effectively [manage and operate](https://thenewstack.io/5-steps-to-cross-the-operational-chasm-in-incident-management/) the consolidated monitoring platform. And remember to consider your organizational structure. You should adjust roles and responsibilities to ensure smooth collaboration and knowledge sharing once the new platform is in place.

A gradual approach is best for the implementation phase. Because trying to consolidate everything simultaneously can be overwhelming and disruptive, prioritize your consolidation targets instead. Start with tools that have significant overlap or those that are less critical to your core operations. Consider running a pilot program to test the consolidated solution in a controlled environment before rolling it out across the entire organization. When you start migrating tools and data, do it in phases, allowing time for testing and adjustments along the way.

You also need to crunch the numbers. Develop a realistic budget that covers all the costs associated with tool consolidation. This includes licensing fees for the new platform, implementation expenses, training costs, and ongoing support or maintenance fees. But don’t just focus on the costs; evaluate the potential cost savings. Consolidating your monitoring tools can reduce licensing fees, improve operational efficiency, and increase productivity. Calculate the return on investment (ROI) to demonstrate the long-term financial benefits of consolidation.

## It Takes A Village To Implement
It’s wise to start with a small-scale pilot program. This will allow you to test the consolidated solution in a controlled environment and iron out any wrinkles before rolling it out across the entire organization. You can choose a specific use case or a subset of your IT infrastructure for the pilot. However, make sure to define clear objectives and success metrics to [measure the consolidated solution’s effectiveness in this smaller setting](https://thenewstack.io/set-goals-and-measure-progress-for-effective-ai-deployment/). The feedback you gather from pilot users will be invaluable in identifying any issues or areas for improvement before you go big.

You need a solid plan for moving your existing monitoring [data to the consolidated platform](https://thenewstack.io/snowflake-consolidates-platform-expands-ai/). This might involve [transforming or cleansing the data](https://thenewstack.io/chatting-with-data-llms-are-transforming-aiops/) to ensure compatibility with the new system. Prioritize [data migration based on criticality and business](https://thenewstack.io/observability-is-not-observability-when-it-comes-to-business-kpis/) needs. Throughout the process, maintain a laser focus on data integrity and consistency. You don’t want to lose valuable insights or introduce errors during the migration.

Again, let’s not forget about your team. They need to be equipped to use the new consolidated solution effectively. Evaluate your technical team’s readiness and appetite for change by engaging them early in the consolidation discussion. Understanding their pain points and preferred tools can reveal valuable insights about which solutions will gain the most traction and support. This will help you assess their training needs and develop a comprehensive program covering all platform aspects, from primary navigation to advanced troubleshooting. Hands-on training and knowledge-sharing sessions can be incredibly helpful in getting everyone up to speed. And remember to create user documentation and support resources for ongoing assistance.

To this end, engage with distinguished engineers and senior ICs from different teams during consolidation planning. Their deep historical knowledge of legacy systems and organizational context can provide invaluable insights into potential challenges and opportunities, even if not all suggestions are ultimately implemented.
