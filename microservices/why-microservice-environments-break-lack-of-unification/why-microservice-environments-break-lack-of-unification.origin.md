In a typical organization building microservices, the software development life cycle (SDLC) flows through a patchwork of disconnected environments. Code moves from local development, often on Docker Compose or a single-node Kubernetes cluster, into continuous integration (CI) pipelines filled with mocks, into preproduction setups that are only partly realistic, and sometimes through additional stages like user acceptance testing (UAT). Every step introduces drift, maintenance overhead and more distance from the real production environment.

Each of these stages introduces its own environment, with its own maintenance burden, risks and failure modes. [Platform teams](https://thenewstack.io/platform-engineering/) are left maintaining them all, even though none of them are fully consistent. The result is a steady buildup of friction, divergence and maintenance debt.

This is the [microservice environment](https://thenewstack.io/microservices/) problem: fragmentation by default.

## How We Got Here
We didn’t get here because we were careless. We got here solving real, hard problems with the tools we had. The reality was we had to make trade-offs between speed and fidelity.

Giving every developer a full copy of production wasn’t practical, especially once companies started running 20, 30 or more microservices. Local setups became too heavy, too slow and too brittle. On the other extreme, doing everything with mocks meant faster feedback but at the cost of realism, and real bugs still slipped into production.

This tension between complexity, speed and realism shaped the environment sprawl we live with today:

- CI too slow? Add mocks.
- Staging too brittle? Make a lighter one.
- Devs blocked on local? Hack it with scripts and stubs.
Each step made sense at the time. But over time, we ended up with a scattered mess of environments that don’t quite talk to each other, and definitely don’t match production. And now, much of our energy goes into keeping this structure working, rather than improving it in meaningful ways.

## Why It’s Starting To Hurt
Fragmented environments create friction everywhere:

- Bugs show up late or only in staging.
- Tests pass in CI but fail in production.
- Local dev setups become slow and unreliable.
The bigger issue is the ongoing toil. Platform teams end up wiring together multiple environment setups, draining time that could be spent improving DevEx, abstracting complexity and enabling faster delivery. Instead of moving the organization forward, they’re stuck fighting infrastructure.

Every patch, more mocks and heavier scripts only add to the burden.

## The Good News: Infra Has Leveled Up
Here’s what makes this moment different: We’re not stuck anymore.

Kubernetes provides a common orchestration platform, and [service meshes](https://thenewstack.io/service-mesh/) like Istio and Linkerd add the critical missing piece: fine-grained, request-level traffic control. These tools enable developers to run multiple isolated versions of services inside the same shared cluster, without clashing.

That means you can:

- Route traffic on a per-request basis, not just per-service.
- Deploy isolated versions of microservices without replicating the entire stack.
- Share a common environment safely across development, testing, staging and validation.
- Enable
[ephemeral](https://thenewstack.io/smart-ephemeral-environments-share-more-copy-less), high-fidelity environments that can be spun up and torn down quickly.
As I wrote [previously](https://thenewstack.io/using-istio-or-linkerd-to-unlock-ephemeral-environments/), these infrastructure capabilities finally make it realistic to unify environments across the SDLC. Instead of maintaining many different brittle setups, you can compose one strong, reusable foundation that supports everything.

![Microservices environments have evolved from disconnected to unified environments.](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/05/a1d5f947-microservices-evolution.png)
The building blocks are here. Now it’s about stitching them together the right way.

## A Better Path Forward
Instead of maintaining five separate environments, a better path is to build a unified, production-like environment that supports development, testing, quality assurance (QA) and end-to-end validation. By making this environment multitenant and dynamic, teams can avoid recreating and patching reality at every step.

This unification massively simplifies the platform engineering burden. Instead of solving the same environment problems many different ways, platform teams can focus higher up the stack: improving developer experience, tightening feedback loops and accelerating delivery.

## Signs of Change
Many organizations are moving toward a unified environment model: a single, production-like base shared across development, testing and beyond.

Brex, for example, made this shift and saw a significant improvement in developer satisfaction and an over 90% reduction in infrastructure costs while scaling testing across hundreds of engineers. A strong environment foundation helps everything above it move faster and feel lighter.

At Signadot, we’ve built a hosted platform that makes it easy to adopt this model within your own Kubernetes clusters. If you’re feeling the weight of fragmented environments, you’re not alone. There’s a better way within reach.
