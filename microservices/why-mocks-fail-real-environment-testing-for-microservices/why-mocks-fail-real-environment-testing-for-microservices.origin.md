“Despite all our unit and integration tests passing, we’re seeing a lot of broken flows in staging. Teams spend days debugging there.” This confession from a VP of engineering at a fintech company with more than 100 microservices captures a familiar frustration. While unit and contract tests showed green, real integration issues kept flooding the staging environment.

When engineering teams embrace microservices, testing strategies often [center on mocks](https://thenewstack.io/the-struggle-to-test-microservices-before-merging/) and simulations. It seems like the ideal way to “shift left,” enabling developers to validate functionality early in the cycle without waiting for full environments. But what happens when mocking becomes the primary testing strategy?

Mocking isn’t inherently flawed, but teams often treat mocks as high-fidelity representations of real systems. The reality? Maintaining mocks across many services is a monumental task. API changes and evolving business logic create a drift between mocks and real systems, letting bugs slip through.

## Why Over-Indexing on Mocks Fails
Mocks excel at testing negative cases and scenarios requiring very specific inputs. They allow teams to validate isolated functionality and reproduce edge cases effectively. However, complex behaviors of the real world — such as dynamic dependency chains and nuanced [API interactions](https://thenewstack.io/api-management/) — are often impossible to simulate with sufficient fidelity. But as the complexity of a [microservices ecosystem](https://thenewstack.io/microservices/) grows, mocks alone can’t:

**Capture real-world interactions:**Dependency chains and network effects are hard to simulate.**Adapt dynamically:**As APIs evolve, mocks require constant updates.**Surface integration issues early:**Without real dependencies, many integration failures go unnoticed until staging.
This over-reliance leads to a double hit: the cost of maintaining mocks and the overhead of debugging integration failures in staging.

## Rethinking ‘Shift Left’: The Hybrid Approach
“Shift left” doesn’t have to mean “more mocking.” It’s about moving meaningful feedback to earlier in the development cycle. A hybrid approach that combines mocking with real-environment feedback offers the best of both worlds:

**Use mocks**for edge cases and scenarios requiring controlled inputs.**Leverage real environments**to validate integration flows, complex API behaviors and performance characteristics against real dependencies.
## Real-World Testing: Benefits and Challenges
Real-environment testing is invaluable for addressing the limitations of mocks, especially when validating complex API behaviors. However, maintaining high-fidelity environments for testing has historically been challenging due to:

**Cost:**Realistic environments are expensive to set up and maintain.**Operational complexity:**Managing and scaling such environments introduce significant overhead.**Contention:**Shared environments create bottlenecks when multiple teams compete for resources.
## Real-Environment Testing With Sandboxes: A Game Changer
Testing on real environments is becoming more accessible, thanks to approaches like [sandboxes](https://thenewstack.io/shifting-testing-left-the-request-isolation-solution/). This approach eliminates the high cost and complexity of setting up production-like environments, making it feasible for teams of all sizes to test effectively in real environments.

Here’s how sandboxes address common challenges:

**Validate contracts:**Test API changes against live downstream dependencies in isolated slices of a shared environment.**Uncover integration issues:**Detect and resolve flow breakages early without waiting for staging.**Scale performance testing:**Simulate realistic traffic patterns without replicating full environments.
With sandboxes, each change gets its own isolated testing space, enabling teams to run real-environment tests efficiently and without contention. This approach reduces the reliance on mocks for high-fidelity scenarios, bringing real-world feedback earlier in the development cycle while keeping costs under control.

## Conclusion
Mocks remain a valuable tool in the testing toolbox, but they’re not the end-all solution. Real-environment feedback is essential for catching integration issues and validating system behavior in a way mocks can’t replicate. By adopting a hybrid approach with real environment testing, engineering teams can reduce staging bottlenecks, improve developer velocity and achieve greater confidence in their microservices.
