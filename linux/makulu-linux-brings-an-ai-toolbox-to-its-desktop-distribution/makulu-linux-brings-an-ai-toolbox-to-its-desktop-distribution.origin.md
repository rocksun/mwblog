Makulu Linux is a [Linux distribution](https://thenewstack.io/beyond-ubuntu-other-linux-distributions-you-should-try/) you’ve probably never heard of, which is a shame because it’s pretty cool. This flavor of Linux is based on Debian and serves as a rolling release with multiple editions, which are:

**Core**– a highly customized GNOME-based desktop**Flash**– a tweaked version of the Xfce desktop**LinDoz**– a Cinnamon desktop configured to look like Windows
A lot of the parts that make up [Makulu Linux](https://www.makululinux.com/wp/) might not seem all that familiar, but that doesn’t prevent the distribution from being easy to use. In fact, just about anyone could log into the Core desktop and immediately know what to do.

There are a few distinct additions to the Makulu Linux desktop that help to make it stand out. I’ll get to those in a moment, but first, let’s talk about what makes Makulu Linux different while remaining the same.

For example, the MakuluLinux Update Manager (**Figure 1**) doesn’t look like a typical modern Linux distribution updater. At the same time, the updater is as easy to use as any other. And that, my friends, is key to understanding this distribution: It might look slightly different than what you’re used to, but those differences aren’t enough to make this desktop OS even remotely challenging.

Makulu Linux also includes plenty of software that you might not have used (or known you were using), but will still be instantly familiar. For example, instead of including the Chrome web browser, Makulu goes with [Chromium](https://thenewstack.io/google-brings-rust-into-chromium-project/) (which is what Chrome is based on).

## Very AI-Centric
What’s really impressive about Makulu Linux is the sheer amount of pre-installed software it includes. A quick peek into the menu and you’ll see a cornucopia of applications, including several that start with Electra.

What are these Electra applications?

This is where things get interesting (for some).

The latest version of Makulu Linux integrates artificial intelligence into traditional desktop usage, thanks to its new AI platform, called Electra. Electra has been integrated into the following applications:

- Voice Assistant – similar to Siri or Google Gemini
- Desktop Widget – allows quick, text-based interaction with Electra.
- Terminal Interface – makes it possible for users to interact with Electra via text or voice commands.
- Web Interface – Electra can be accessed via a web browser interface
- Desktop Chat Client – a more traditional chat client for interacting with Electra
- Information Mode – provides quick results with web links to reference data.
- Electra AI Editor – text editor with AI-powered autocorrect and text editing features.
- System Updates – allows Electra to perform system updates when requested by the user
- Automated History – Electra remembers previous conversations across sessions and even reboots.
If you open the Electra AI ToolBox (from a clickable link on the desktop), you’ll find quick access to all of these tools (**Figure 2**).

Figure 2: All of these apps interact with the built-in AI.

I tried some of the Electra apps and came away pretty impressed. My first test was the Electra AI Interface GUI (**Figure 3**).

Even the image generator worked surprisingly well (**Figure 4**).

And, of course, there’s the AI assistant, which gives you quick access to many of the AI tools from a single UI (**Figure 5**).

Finally, there’s the AI Therapist tool. I tested this and found it to be a workable option for those who might have questions to ask and don’t have immediate access to a therapist. I wouldn’t, however, consider this to be a replacement for an actual therapist, but it’s a nice addition.

One thing to keep in mind, however, is that not every AI app or feature is available in the free version. For example, there’s an AI Editor that includes buttons for Submit a Request and Generate Image, both of which are only available in the [Makulu Pro edition](https://www.makululinux.com/wp/makululinux-shift-pro-upgrade/), which costs $33.

Other Pro features are:

- Electra AI-Image Gen
- AI World
- Full voice to AI system
- Full voice control
- Additional layouts, wallpapers, cursors, icons, themes, and styles
- More widgets and special effects
## The Desktop Manager
Another nice feature found in Makulu Linux is similar to that found in Zorin OS and allows you to quickly change the desktop layout. With the free version, you get four layouts: bottom dock, top dock, bottom panel, and top panel. You also get the ability to change the theme color, download additional themes, configure scrollbar behavior, and more.

A quick change to the bottom dock layout and you have a macOS-like UI (**Figure 6**).

## Who Is Makulu Linux for?
It’s pretty simple: you would use Makulu Linux if desktop-integrated artificial intelligence is an important feature. If you’re just here for the different desktop layouts, go with Zorin OS, but no other Linux distribution has managed to integrate AI to this level and it’s impressive.

If you need the help of AI for your daily grind, Makulu Linux would be an outstanding option, otherwise, I’d suggest Zorin OS, elementary OS, Linux Mint, Ubuntu Budgie, or Pop!_OS.
