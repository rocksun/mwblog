# 抛开Ubuntu：你应该尝试的其他Linux发行版

![Featued image for: Beyond Ubuntu: Other Linux Distributions You Should Try](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2025/01/23c006dd-getty-images-ho3yfu7ksb8-unsplash-1024x680.jpg)

[Linux生态系统](https://thenewstack.io/learning-linux-start-here/)非常庞大。几年前，我就不再尝试追踪[有多少Linux发行版](https://thenewstack.io/choosing-a-linux-distribution/)了，因为这已经成为一项不可能完成的任务。不用说，有数百种基于[Linux内核](https://thenewstack.io/linux-kernel-6-12-is-official-real-time-app-support-better-scheduling/)的操作系统。

你可能不知道的是，许多这些发行版都基于少数几个版本，其中之一是[Ubuntu](https://thenewstack.io/10-reasons-to-choose-ubuntu-server-over-the-competition/)。如果没有Ubuntu，我们就不会有Kubuntu、Lubuntu、Edubuntu、[Zorin OS](https://thenewstack.io/zorin-os-the-perfect-linux-distro-for-migrating-from-windows/)、[elementary OS](https://thenewstack.io/elementary-os-a-linux-distro-easy-to-use-and-easy-on-the-eyes/)等等许多其他的发行版。

但是，如果Ubuntu（或其衍生版）不适合你呢？你会转向哪里？幸运的是，即使不考虑Ubuntu，你仍然有很多选择，所有这些都是优秀的桌面发行版。

让我们来看一些可用的选项，每一个都能出色地满足你的桌面需求。

## Fedora

在过去的五年里，我看到由[Red Hat](https://www.openshift.com/try?utm_content=inline+mention)支持的[Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)从一个我只会推荐给那些拥有大量Linux经验的用户的发行版，变成了一个我几乎会推荐给任何人的发行版。但即使超越了用户友好性，[Fedora最令人印象深刻的方面之一就是它的速度](https://thenewstack.io/fedora-41-offers-zippy-performance/)。不知何故，开发人员采用了[Linux](https://thenewstack.io/introduction-to-linux-operating-system)和一个完整的桌面环境，并使其感觉像一个轻量级发行版，可以为旧硬件带来新的生命，并使新硬件感觉像是来自未来。多年来我一直是基于Ubuntu的发行版的用户，但每次我将Fedora安装为虚拟机时，我都会考虑切换。Fedora的一个非常好的地方是，你可以下载不同的“[衍生版](https://store.dji.com/product/dji-neo?vid=169761)”(spins)，每个衍生版都使用不同的桌面环境（例如KDE Plasma、Xfce、Cinnamon、Mate-Compiz、i3、LXQT、LXDE、SOAS、Sway或Budgie）。

## Manjaro

[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)可能是最流行的基于Arch的Linux发行版。为什么你不直接使用原生的Arch呢？如果你曾经尝试安装Arch Linux，你就知道我在说什么。Arch没有图形安装程序。相反，你运行一个脚本，这对于胆小的人来说并不容易。另一方面，Manjaro包含一个用户友好的安装程序，其易用性与市场上任何Linux发行版一样简单。而且由于Manjaro享有与Arch相同的稳定性，你知道这是一个你可以信赖的发行版。使用Manjaro，你可以从三种不同的桌面环境中选择：Xfce、KDE Plasma或GNOME。虽然Arch使用的pacman包管理器不如apt或dnf用户友好，但始终存在Pamac图形前端。还有Octopi，它必须使用命令`yay -Syu octopi`安装。你可能会发现Pamac可以满足你对包管理的所有需求。需要注意的是，Manjaro是一个滚动发布发行版，它比[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)进行了更多的测试。如果你喜欢确保始终拥有最新的软件，那么滚动发布发行版非常适合你。

## Nobara
[Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/) offers a unique take on Fedora, providing five different versions of its Linux-based operating system: customized KDE Plasma, GNOME, a minimal KDE Plasma, Steam-HTPC, and Steam-Handheld.  The customized KDE Plasma version is quite beautiful.  Unlike many Linux distributions, Nobara targets all types of users, including gamers. Nobara comes pre-installed with Steam and ProtonPlus, ensuring games are easy to install and run. You'll also find all the necessary applications pre-installed, such as LibreOffice, Firefox, KDE Connect, Web Apps, Inkscape, Elisa (music player), Kamoso (webcam application), and more. For Linux newcomers, you can trust Nobara to be a completely "click-and-go" operating system, meaning you won't have to worry about installing third-party codecs or relying on the terminal window to get things done. Some of the changes Nobara makes to Fedora include various kernel patches, the latest Mesa version, a Glibc patch disabling clone3, NVIDIA GPU detection and automatic driver installation, and more.

## openSUSE

[openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) doesn't get the attention it deserves. While [this Linux distribution](https://thenewstack.io/opensuse-tumbleweed-an-ideal-desktop-for-linux-admins-power-users/) isn't ideal for novice users, experienced users will be very happy with this version of the open-source operating system. One of openSUSE's best features is YaST (Yet Another Setup Tool), which offers far more functionality than your average system settings application. With openSUSE, you get the usual system settings, which is great for average users, but the inclusion of YaST gives administrators all the power they need to configure Samba, virtual machines, boot loaders, firewall configurations, and many other system-related things. Think of system settings as user-facing, and YaST as administrator-facing. openSUSE comes in two versions: Tumbleweed (rolling release) and Leap (regular release). If you want the latest version of everything, choose Tumbleweed. If stability is your top priority, choose Leap. Either way, openSUSE is a solid choice.

## Solus

[Solus](https://getsol.us/) claims to be the personal operating system for personal computers, a modern operating system that meets your everyday needs. Solus is a strong contender for home or office, developers, content creators, gamers, and everyone in between. Solus offers four different versions: Budgie, GNOME, KDE Plasma, and XFCE. Note that the XFCE version is in testing, so use it with caution. If you want the most user-friendly version of Solus, choose Budgie or KDE Plasma. Solus isn't based on Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch. In fact, Solus is built from the ground up, meaning you won't find traditional package managers in it. It's completely unique and works exceptionally well. In my opinion, the best version of Solus is Budgie, as I'm a big fan of that desktop.

## Serpent OS

[Serpent OS](https://serpentos.com/) is new... or rather, kind of new. Created by Ikey Doherty (co-lead of the Solus project), Serpent OS has been in development for five years and is only now reaching its Alpha stage.  Another distribution built from the ground up, it uses a tool called Moss to manage the system state, so if something goes wrong, the OS can revert to its default state. Serpent OS is an atomic distribution, but unlike Fedora Silverblue or Steam OS, it allows the system to remain stateless in the `/etc` directory. What does this mean? If you mess something up in `/etc`, you can delete it, and the system will automatically revert to the default settings without needing a reinstall. This is definitely a game-changer, and when Serpent OS finally releases a stable version, it's sure to take the Linux world by storm. Serpent OS currently offers GNOME or the [COSMIC desktop](https://system76.com/cosmic/?srsltid=AfmBOooo2bfQV3phy_owImavYct_LnG3RrPeGOBO3YldxdO4xigwRYhw) (a KDE Plasma version is in development). Remember, this is still in Alpha, so don't use it for daily driving. Even the installer is done through the terminal window (a GUI is planned), so it's not for the faint of heart. I've tried the Serpent OS Alpha, and I'm impressed.
