I’ve been using Linux since 1997. It all began after my first Windows “blue screen of death” and my desire to get away from the constant issues I faced with the Microsoft OS. My first distribution (purchased from a local computer store) was OpenCaldera 1.0, but I immediately ran into trouble. For one the UI was vastly different than what I was accustomed to. As well, I couldn’t get my internal modem to work. With ignorance filling my sails, I went back to the store and purchased a copy of [Red Hat 5.0](https://www.openshift.com/try?utm_content=inline+mention), raced home, and installed it.

The UI was much better but the modem still didn’t work. Turns out, my PC had one of the dreaded Winmodems that Linux couldn’t recognize or work with. After purchasing an external US Robotics modem, all was good and I quickly realized that Linux was my OS of choice.

Not everyone has the patience or ability to make such a complicated migration, which is why Linux distributions like [Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/) are so important.

I have a rather unique take on what makes an effective [Linux desktop distribution](https://thenewstack.io/project-bluefin-a-linux-desktop-for-serious-developers/) and it’s all centered around the UI. If you can create a UI that is both steeped in the past and tied to the future, it could be successful.

What do I mean by that? You have an interface that is immediately familiar to users but also offers some very modern touches. Create that and [Microsoft Windows](https://news.microsoft.com/?utm_content=inline+mention) and macOS users won’t look at the distribution as if it was created by an advanced alien race with technology far beyond ours.

Zorin OS is one of those distributions that strikes a perfect balance between the past and the future. It’s an operating system that is flexible enough that any type of user can easily configure it to meet their needs.

If you’re a macOS user, there’s a layout for you. Ditto for the Windows users. If you’re familiar with Linux, you’ll find layouts that resemble KDE Plasma, GNOME, Cinnamon, and more. Even better, Zorin OS comes with an app (Zorin Appearance — Figure 1) that makes switching the layout easy enough that anyone can do it.

Zorin OS is based on Ubuntu, which means, from the ground up, it’s user-friendly, stable, and reliable. The latest release (17.2) is based on [Ubuntu 22.04](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-safely-upgrade-ubuntu-22-04-to-ubuntu-24-04/), which is a long-term release candidate and will receive standard support until June 2027.

## What’s New With 17.2?
Version 17.2 is not a major release, so the new features aren’t exactly mind-blowing. I like to think of point releases as a means to polish a major release and the latest from Zorin OS does exactly that.

The new features to arrive include:

- Third-party theme installation guide.
- A more powerful “Quick Find” tool.
- Built-in support for Flatpak, Snap, and AppImages.
- Cursor customization.
- Window behavior (such as window placement and title bar button location.)
- Dynamic overlay scrollbar toggling.
- Improved security.
- Better hardware support (for Intel and AMD CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, Logitech peripherals, various gamepads, and even Lenovo keyboards.)
As you can see, there aren’t any blockbuster features for this release but that doesn’t mean it’s a release or upgrade you should ignore. More than anything, however, Zorin OS 17.2 is still Zorin OS, which means it’s about as rock-solid an operating system can be.

## Pre-Installed Apps
As for pre-installed apps, you’ll find the latest version of the apps you need ready to go, including LibreOffice (with improved Microsoft Office compatibility), Firefox, Remmina (remote desktop viewer), Image Viewer, Photos (webcam app), Videos, Rhythmbox (music app), Sound Recorder, Evolution (group ware — similar to Outlook), Disk Usage Analyzer, Backups, and more.

One thing to consider is that Zorin OS doesn’t ship with a large number of toolchain-type apps pre-installed. You won’t find gcc, make, or a wealth of developer tools at the ready. Sure, Zorin OS 172. does ship with [Python 3.10.12](https://thenewstack.io/python-under-the-hood/) but nearly all Linux distributions include Python out of the box. If you are a developer, you can install the necessary tools you need with ease, most of which are found in the standard repositories.

For example, you can install the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which includes compilers for C, C++, Objective C, Fortran, Ada, Go, and D. This also installs binutils, dpkg-dev, fakeroot, and all the necessary libraries. Install this package with the command:

1 |
sudo apt-get install build-essential -y |
Because Zorin OS does roll Flatpak and Snap support into the GUI app store (aptly named Software), you can install third-party proprietary software such as Spotify and Slack without having to use the command line or add extra repositories. There are also several IDEs you can install from within Software, such as IntelliJ, Eclipse, Arduino IDE, Android Studio, and more.
## Who Is Zorin OS Right for?
Simply put, Zorin OS is an operating system that could be used by anyone. Whether you have experience with Linux or not, Zorin OS makes the migration from either Windows or macOS a breeze. There are only a handful of Linux distributions that I would recommend to those without any prior Linux experience and Zorin OS is one of them. As far as I’m concerned, Zorin OS is one of the best distributions for migrating from either macOS or Windows and not having to spend hours, days, or weeks, struggling to figure out how to interact with OS or be productive.

Zorin OS really is that good.

I would recommend starting with Zorin OS Core (which is free). If you enjoy that version, spend the $47.99 for the Pro version and enjoy six premium desktop layouts, a professional-grade creative suite of apps, advanced productivity tools, and support.

You can download Core (the basic version), Education (a version geared for students), or Pro (the Mack Daddy version with all the bells and whistles) from the [official Zorin OS download site](https://zorin.com/os/download/). If you’re using Zorin OS Core, you can purchase a Pro license and upgrade to the paid version from within the Zorin OS upgrade tool.
