Atomic Linux distributions are all the rage at the moment because they offer enhanced security, stability, and simplified update mechanisms.

But what is an atomic distribution?

Let’s just get right to the heart of this particular situation. An atomic Linux distribution is all about how applications are installed and upgraded. Let me paint a picture.

You’re happily using your operating system when an upgrade notification appears. You innocently click to allow the update to happen, but during the process, something goes wrong (which is actually rare with [Linux](https://thenewstack.io/learning-linux-start-here/)). After the upgrade completes (with you not knowing something went wrong), you reboot, only to find the OS no longer works properly.

What do you do?

If you were using an atomic distribution, the OS wouldn’t allow the upgrade to happen. In other words, it’s an all or none scenario, and if an upgrade cannot happen without issue, it won’t happen at all. Even if the upgrade happens, you can always select a viable snapshot during boot.

What this does is ensure you always have a working instance of your OS.

Yeah, atomic distributions are a smart way to go.

But they aren’t just about upgrades. Another very important aspect of atomic distributions is that the core system is read-only, which means the base files and configurations cannot be directly modified. That’s all about [security](https://thenewstack.io/linux-security-scan-your-servers-for-rootkits-with-ease/), and it works very well.

Now, let’s talk about [HeliumOS](https://www.heliumos.org).

## What Is HeliumOS?

HeliumOS takes [Red Hat](https://www.openshift.com/try?utm_content=inline+mention)‘s [CentOS Stream](https://thenewstack.io/back-to-the-future-a-look-at-centos-streams/), rebases it with [AlmaLinux](https://thenewstack.io/almalinux-10-beta-supports-older-x86-chipsets/), and gives it an atomic spin. In that regard, HeliumOS offers:

* A version of CentOS that includes the KDE Plasma desktop for a user-friendly, highly customizable experience.
* An app store that is comprised of Flatpak packages for up-to-date, sandboxed apps.
* A promise of 10 years of support with new features, bug fixes, and security updates.
* An atomic desktop OS that doesn’t get in the way.

You’re probably thinking, “But aren’t CentOS and AlmaLinux server OSes?” Why, yes, they are. Does that, in turn, make HeliumOS a server OS?

No, it doesn’t.

In fact, HeliumOS is marketed as an atomic desktop OS.

So, imagine getting the power, flexibility, stability, and security of a server OS on a desktop? And then, you make it atomic for added security and reliability.

Now we’re talkin’ about something special.

I installed HeliumOS to give it the ol’ test run to see if it was a worthy contender for your desktop. What I found took me by surprise.

## My First Impression

My first impression was that HeliumOS’s take on KDE was pretty sweet. It has just the right blend of eye candy and performance. One very nice touch that I noticed is that when using the desktop menu, you get a nice bit of transparency (Figure 1).

However, if you have an application open and maximized, the menu and panel lose their transparency in favor of reliability (Figure 2).

Next up is the contents of the desktop menu, which are somewhat spare. You’ll find the Angelfish web browser, which is a QtWebEngine-based browser with DuckDuckGo as the default search engine. This browser is fast, renders well, and strips away a lot of the bloat found in other browsers. You won’t find any signs of AI; there are no extensions, but you can easily create web apps, customize your search engine, and enjoy several ad-blocking lists. That’s about the extent of Angelfish. If that doesn’t suit your needs, you can always open Discover (the KDE Plasma app center) and install whatever browser you want.

Speaking of which…

When you open the app center, you’ll find that most (if not all) apps are of the [flatpak type](https://thenewstack.io/linux-an-intro-to-the-flatpak-universal-package-manager/). That suits HeliumOS perfectly well, because the apps are all sandboxed for added security and reliability (which is what this OS is all about).

Installing apps with Discover (even when they are of the Flatpak sort) is as simple as searching for the app you want and clicking Install from Flathub (Figure 3).

Another really nifty feature of HeliumOS is that, when you install an application from within Discover, you’ll find an indicator in the menu that something new was installed (Figure 4).

## Support, Support, Support

If you’re looking for a Linux distribution with long-term support, HeliumOS is a great option because it offers 10 years of support, which includes bug fixes, new features, and security updates. Ten years is a long time to rely on an operating system, but HeliumOS wants to make that a reality for you.

But is it worthy of your desktop?

In a word, yes. Normally, I might not be so inclined as to recommend a server-based OS for a desktop, but HeliumOS has changed my mind. That’s not to say HeliumOS is for servers, as it’s not. HeliumOS is only based on a server OS and twisted and tweaked until it is perfectly suited to be your desktop operating system.

After my testing concluded, I realized just how impressed I was with HeliumOS and would happily recommend it as a desktop operating system for anyone from those new to Linux all the way up to seasoned users. HeliumOS is dependable, easy to use, secure, and free. What more do you want from your OS?

And if you want to add gaming into the mix, there’s always Bottles and Steam, both of which can be installed from within Discover.

If you’re interested in trying HeliumOS, [download the ISO](https://www.heliumos.org/download) now and install it on a spare machine or as a virtual machine with VirtualBox.
